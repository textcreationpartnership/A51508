            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This <hi>Daulphin</hi> had but one onely Daughter, whoſe exquiſite beauty was ſo beautified with rareſt vertues, that men honoured Nature as a God in her perfections, and held her more then a Woman in her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Amongſt many Knights that then followed her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court, there was a moſt well deſerving aged Knight (who was knowne to bee as ſufficient, as he was ſufficiently knowne) named Sir <hi>Jaques,</hi> who had but one onely Son called <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe but budding yeares, deckt with Natures pride, and honoured with timely Knighthood, well cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged Renowne for his right, <hi>Venus</hi> for his friend, and <hi>Fortune</hi> for his ſervant. But it fortuned (ſo <hi>Fortune</hi> would) that this young Knight caſting caſually his careleſſe eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in Court, eſpyed the young Princeſſe, the faire <hi>Vienna,</hi> (for ſo after the City was ſhee called) talking with her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>deered friend the Lady <hi>Izabella,</hi> whoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demeanour he ſo devoutly noted, and whoſe unparalel'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59993:6"/>beauty hee ſo feelingly admired, that openly commending the one, he ſecretly affected the other. Many were the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted thoughts that now troubled his troubled minde, and more then many were the unquiet and univerſuall cares that now attended his new entertained deſires. Still hee gazed, and gazing ſigh't, and ſighing grieved that ſo he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, yet could hee not ceaſe to feed his hungry eye, nor durſt hee once be ſeene to looke on her, on whom he could not bur looke. For as commanding love did flatter his a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hope; ſo the remembrance of <hi>Phaetons</hi> fall, did diſmay him with a deadly feare. And feare hee did, leaſt that juſt diſdaine would beget in her bitter revenge, and blacke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſhould bring forth untimely deaths.</p>
            <p>Thus in ſeeking to paſſe the meane, poore <hi>Paris</hi> dyed for being ſo meane, and in this diſconſolation glad hee was to ſmother his ſorrow to his greater griefe, nor daring to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint any but <hi>La-nova</hi> his ſecond ſelfe, his companion in Armes, and the ſole ſecreter of all his ſecrets. To him, and none but him, did hee in ſorrow bewray his love, and in love bewayle his ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La-nova</hi> pittying his caſe, diſſwaded him from the danger of <hi>Ixions</hi> love, leaſt with more repentance hee vainely with <hi>Apollo</hi> purſued <hi>Daphne.</hi> Heavens forbid (ſaid hee) my <hi>Paris</hi> eye ſhould with the Eagle ſore againſt ſo bright a Sunne; or that your deſire ſhould with the Bee delight in ſuch flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, which being ſuckt, will yeeld more poyſon then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Ah <hi>Paris, Paris,</hi> ſeeke not to obtaine that with care, which you cannot keepe without danger. To deſire to bee a King, is no juſt tytle of a Kingdome; and to ſay you love her, no ſufficient deſert to winne her. Deſire not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy reach, leaſt thou fall in thy hope. Nay, admit that her chaſt conceits would entertaine <hi>Venus</hi> deceits, yet followes it not, that <hi>Ioves</hi> royall bird would prey on ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flies. <hi>Alexander</hi> would deale with none but Kings, nor <hi>Vienna</hi> with any but Princes; low ſhrubs wither ever at the Cedars roote. Beware <hi>Paris,</hi> leaſt coveting with <hi>Iearus</hi> to ſoare above the Sunne, thou bee puniſhed in his pride under the Sunne. Thy deſerts are J confeſſe many, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59993:6"/>but the ſtate of her eſtate ſtands not with thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities; men are wey'd by the aboundance of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, not by the worthineſſe of their vertues. Then wade no further in this foord, but let Armours, nor Amours, bee the ſubject of thy thoughts, ſince the Campe affords ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the Court ſuch dangers.</p>

               <hi>Paris</hi> thus dehorted, reſembled the Palme-tree, that the more it is preſt downe, the more it ſtriveth upwards, ſo the more his friend miſliked of that hee deſired; the more hee deſired what ſo his friend miſliked. Such was the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable force of his inlimitable affection, that in ſpite of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hee was enforc'd to doe homage unto paſſion. For where Love is predominant, there all other affections attend on it. And therefore hee concluded ſtill, and ever to love her; but ſtill, and never to let it bee knowne to her. To approve which, hee requeſted <hi>La-nova's</hi> company that night ſecretly to give <hi>Vienna</hi> muſicke, who ſeeing his unremoveable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, vowed himſelfe to his fortunes. The ſame night when quiet ſleepe poſſeſt each weary eye, hee and <hi>La-nova</hi> taking eyther of them a well tuned Lute, went directly under <hi>Vienna's</hi> window, where ſweetly ſtriking their pleaſant ſtrings, Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thus chearefully warbled out his Ladies praiſe.</p>

                  <l>That Love, proud Love; is worſe then Hell.</l>

            <p>This ſorrowfull Song ended, the Muſicke ceaſed, and <hi>Paris</hi> returned to his Chamber. But <hi>Vienna</hi> who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively had liſtned to this carefull Ditty, knew not well by his over-paſſionate conceite, and alluding and inſinuating Song, that Love had made her a Miſtris, and Fortune had ſent her a ſervant. Yet could ſhee nor imagine who hee ſhould be, but much ſhe was diſcontented that ſo it ſhould be, her Princely towring thoughts were not ſubject to Subjects fancies, nor would ſhe admit of ſervill fervants. And therefore becauſe ſhe would puniſh their pride in their preſumption, ſhe went the next morning ſecretly to lier Father, and told him how that the two paſſed nights, there had beene ſome (not knowne to her) that had beſtowed Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick on her, under her Chamber window, and how that one of them the firſt night revealed his love in her praiſe; and the ſecond night bewailed his affection in his owne griefe. And therefore ſhe humbly requeſted him, that hee would command a privie Watch to be made that following night,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59993:8"/>that they might be diſcovered in their follies, and ſhee live acquitted of ſuch vaine fancies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daulphin</hi> diſcontent that any in his Province ſhould ſo proudly preſume to build his neſt in the Sunne, gave in ſecret charge, that ſixe of his Guard ſhould watch as that night, to apprehend and bring them before him the next day. All which was done accordingly: And Sir <hi>Paris</hi> not miſdeeming any croſſe adventure, came as hee was wont with <hi>La-nova,</hi> to offer the ſacrifice of his conſecrated Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to his devoted Saint. But they no ſooner tuned, but they were neere over-turned. For the Watchmen fearing their eſcape, thought to make them ſure by laying them on the ground. But Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> provided alwayes for all perils, ſeeing ſuch rude entertainment, and holding them but for ſtraglers, armed his whole endeavours to returne them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne thankes for their ſo unſeaſonable curteſies, in ſomuch that with <hi>La-nova's</hi> furthering ayde hee wounded moſt of their hands. So that being left alone, they eaſily recovered their Chamber, without being diſcovered of any, which ſo much incenſt the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that leaving the reynes of his unlimited anger to his then enraged will, hee commanded that ſecretly twenty men well appointed, ſhould the next night lye in ambuſh to apprehend them.</p>
            <p>Now Sir <hi>Paris</hi> holding that their late diſturbance was rather caſuall, then occaſioned, went, in his unſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the next night againe. But no ſooner had they taken ſtand, but that they found themſelves entrapped in the ſnare; which they finding unreſiſtable, yeelded without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The Watch glad of their apprehenſion, held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſecure of them, that not regarding (the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darke) what they were, they careleſly went along to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle, untill they came by a narrow Lane, that turned into the heart of the City, whereunto Sir <hi>Paris</hi> all ſuddenly thruſting <hi>La-nova</hi> forceably, tooke by force a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd out of the next Watchmans hands, and ſtepping into the Lane, kept the entrance from them all. The Watchmen now grew more furiouſly wrathfull, then adviſedly bold,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59993:8"/>and ſo confuſedly aſſaulted them, that Sir <hi>Paris</hi> laying the firſt three on the ground, the reſt (over-haſtily ſtill preſſing forwards) ſtumbled and fell upon their Companions, ſo many and ſo thick, that themſelves bard themſelves from the entrance, which advantaged Sir <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>La-nova</hi> ſo much, that having time to turne them to the next turning, they got to their Chamber before they were deſcryed, or could bee well purſued. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> underſtanding the next morning of the uprore, and of their eſcape, was much male-contented in himſelfe, the Court wondred at the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but <hi>Vienna</hi> now recounting their undaunted coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with their noble qualities, conceived them to be men of high eſteeme, and now more favourably, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately did labour the knowledge of them, but never after durſt they preſume to venture the like adventure againe, which much grieved <hi>Vienna,</hi> and more incenſed the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> who being fruſtrated of his expectation politickly, yet plotted this deviſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he cauſed a Chriſtall Shield, and a Chaplet of gold to bee made, both, paſſing faire, and rich, then delivering them to a Herald, he commanded him to take them, and to carie them throughout all the Citie, and by ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet proclaime a ſolemne Juſts (free for all commers) to be kept 40. dayes after: And that he that ſhould winne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the day, ſhould by <hi>Viennas</hi> hand be crowned with the ſayd Chaplet as Victor, and receive the ſayd Shield as the beſt deſerving Knight. By this meane meanes, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> thought to find out the unknowne Lover. For it was an Article of his beliefe, that in honour of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would (as a Knight) make tryall of his fortune; and as a Lover diſcloſe himſelfe, in his deviſe; whereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance (the inſtrument of knowledge) might well diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. Great preparation there was made on all ſides, and divers Knights and Barons of ſundry Provinces, came as well to ſee the admired beauty of <hi>Vienna,</hi> as to winne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne for renowned Chivalry. Amongſt whom at laſt, though not leaſt in worth, came Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>La-nova;</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll mounted on white fiery Steedes, ſuteable to theyr white
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59993:9"/>plaine Armour, without either marke, or deviſe: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither durſt vſe for feare of being diſcovered by them. But the day, and the <hi>Daulphin</hi> being come. <hi>Vienna</hi> was ſet (richly roabed in <hi>Arabian Beſſe</hi>) on a faire capiſtred ſcaffold, the Chaplet on her head; and the Chriſtall Shield ſtanding before her at her feete; ſo that ſhe ſeemed another <hi>Pallas</hi> in a ſecond <hi>Venus</hi> ſhape. Many Knights amazedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her, moſt deſired her, all admired her. Thus when each hungry eye had fed, but not fill'd his covetous ſight, the Herold ſtanding up (after the ſummoning ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) bad every Knight doe his beſt devoyre. Then deſire of honour, armed each martiall heart with double courage and every Knights courage was redoubled with hope of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and <hi>Vienna's</hi> favour: So that the Juſts grew great, and both nobly did each Knight, eſpecially <hi>La-nova</hi> bare him ſelfe. But Sir <hi>Paris</hi> whoſe unknowne prowis was not yet fully proved; ſeeing a <hi>Burgonian</hi> proudly brandiſhing his Launce before <hi>Vienna,</hi> for the honour which yet hee bare away from all, was ſo erraged with choller and jealouſie, that fiercely ſpurring his hote ready Horſe, he ſo forceably charged; and over-charged him in the encounter, that hee layd the <hi>Burgenians</hi> pride in the duſt; which <hi>Vienna</hi> noting, noted him for the moſt redoubted, and beſt merriting Knight of them all. Still her eye followed his fortune, and ſtill his fortune was remarkable, and pleaſing to her eye. For never ceaſed he Juſting, nor never Iuſted, but he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſome one, in which performance he was applauded of every one. Such was his heroicall fortitude, and ſuch his quicke delivery, and manly cariage of himſelfe, that in the end there was left none, whom he had not overthrown, nor any overthrowne, that would re-aſſay to overthrow the overthrower. Thus ſtood unvanquiſhed Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> like invincible <hi>Hercules</hi> expecting a charge; but in finding none he found his owne diſcharge. So that the Heralds (with Trumpets ſounding his praiſe) brought him to the ſcaffold, where the fayreſt fayre, and gracious <hi>Vienna</hi> graced his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, with ſetting the Chaplet on his head, and giving him the Chriſtall Shield, ſhe bluſhing ſaid: Receive noble
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59993:9"/>Knight thy moſt well-deſerving honour, and heavens make thee happy both in thy deſignes, and thy deſires. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> more proud of her words, then of his reward, received them at her hands, with more pleaſing content then <hi>Paphos</hi> Queene did the golden fruit, and humbling himſelfe on his knee, hee obſequiouſly reverently, yet fearefully, kiſt her hand, and layd his other on his heart, in token that he was hers in all ſervice; and ſo riſing up hee made a low obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and both parting, both of them looked backe at one inſtant upon each other; a true record, that their liking hearts reioyced in the ſight of either other. But Sir <hi>Paris</hi> being come to the reſt of the Knights, departed with them, and as they rid each one towards his ſeverall home, he and <hi>La-nova</hi> tooke an occaſion to light to mend their Suddles, the reſt paſſing careleſly on, which they ſeeing, tooke the next turning, and ſo were gotten away before they were miſt, and miſt before they were knowne. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> thus deceived by him he meant to deceive, was much agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſo were the Knights that they could not tell by whom they were vanquiſhed; and ſo was <hi>Vienna,</hi> that ſhe knew not by whom ſhe was honoured. She thought and ever looked that he ſhould haue diſcovered himſelfe, that he might the better bee reſpected of her, and the world take further knowledge of him and his merit. But the clouding of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, aſſuredly aſſured her, that he, and none but he, was the man, that ſo ſweetly (under her window) ſang her praiſe; that ſo dolefully recorded the paſſion of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting love; and that ſo valiantly forc'd to flight her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Guard; His ſecret departure, argued (ſhe thought) ſo much; and his unvaluable valour ſhewed no leſſe. Deſire now, of ſhe knew not what, made her loue ſhe knew not whom: oft ſhe wiſht ſhe knew him; ſtill ſhe talkt of him, and ever ſhee highly commended him; but her wiſhes were but vaine thoughts, and her words but as alluring windes.</p>
            <p>During this their diſcontentments. The Duke of <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doume</hi> (now called <hi>Vendoſme</hi>) being brother to the iſſuleſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59993:10"/>King of <hi>France,</hi> a man ſo powerfull in meanes, and ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular in State, that nothing could make him unhappy, but the exceſſe of his happineſſe: This Duke, I ſay, beeing the firſt Prince of the blood, was ſo tranſported with ſuch an aſpiring pride, and unlimitted deſire of Rule, that he could not diſgeſt a ſmall expectation. His deſire of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty caried him ſo beyond the bounds of all reſpects, that neyther Wiſedome could informe his minde, nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſway his actions. Nature nor Duty could preſcribe him any law, though he were a Subject, ſubject to the law. How to gaine the Crowne was all his care: His glorious conſideration thereof. made a continuall examination of all his thoughts, how he ſhould be poſſeſt thereof. Ambition (the Nurſe of diſloyall plots and practiſes) ſayd, The King muſt dye; and Reſolution (the performer of all deeds) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Hee ſhall dye. But how, or by whom; hee know not. Young men (he ſayd) are not ripe enough for ſuch an action, and Old men are too timorous for ſo great an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The raſhneſſe of the one, and the feare of the other, are the ruine of ſuch buſineſſe. To truſt others then, is to deceive my ſelfe; For hope of reward (for the preſervation of a King) will, I feare, betray my truſt; And then I muſt conclude, that though a deſire to ſteale, make not a Thiefe; yet my intent for treaſon, will make me a Traytor; and in the puniſhment thereof, I ſhall finde no diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. What reſteth then but force and Armes? my ſword muſt plead for poſſeſſion, <hi>Rome</hi> could not reſiſt <hi>Ceſar,</hi> when he came to the gates, in the ſtrength of his forces. I will therefore firſt fortifie my ſelfe with potent friends, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the time, my intent, and take counſell of three ſorts of men of the Lawyer, that ſpeakes not as he thinkes; of the Phyſitian, that doth not as he ſayes; and of the Divine, which oftentimes teacheth better then himſelfe leades, and alwayes better then the people follow. I know the leaſt winde of the peoples favour will fill my ſayles full; Their eyes are fixt upon my greatneſſe, and they obſerve mee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for my intereſt; The King hath no iſſue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59993:10"/>of leſſe regard; his time is but ſhort, and Reſpect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waytes on poſterity, that promiſeth continuance of raigne. No ſooner (ſayes ſome) is a Collaterall heire known, but the Kings Teſtament is made; why then ſhould he live to command me, that am borne to rule? He may live to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie me, where then is my Crowne? I muſt and will raigne. Vpon theſe moveable ſands (like a fooliſh Merchant, that adventures all his ſubſtance in a broken veſſell) did this fond Duke build both his reſolve, and his hope; And to give ſucceſſe to his truſt, he ſent preſently to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>Viennois</hi> (whoſe principality was in manner equall with Kingly Royalty) to require his daughter, the faire <hi>Vienna;</hi> in marriage for his ſonne. The haughty <hi>Daulphius</hi> minde, did well ſimpathize the Dukes nature; both their prides, and deſires, were reciprocall: onely the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was more reſerved, and ever better adviſed; but this motion did ſo attarch him with joy, to thinke that his daughter ſhould in time be a Queene, that he covetouſly embrac'd the Dukes requeſt, and wiſhed that Commiſſioners on either ſide, might be nominated, and appointed, to conferre and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thereof.</p>
            <p>This conſent of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> did ſo elevate and animate the Duke, that hee thought himſelfe already an inveſted King. The incorporating of <hi>Daulpheny</hi> to his Dukedome, would (he knew) make him undoubtedly, redoubted great; and the uniting of both their powers with their adheres, would well enable him to affront the King, who now was fitter for a Cloyſter (as hee thought) then for a Crowne. Thus we ſee that where men hath leaſt reaſon, there they are apteſt to beleeve any thing, that but flatters their deſires. Men that fall into Treachery or miſery, not knowne nor fore-ſeene, are worthy of ſome compaſſion; but they that wilfully runne into rebellion, or calamity, deſerve no pitty, but ſhame and death. In all our attempts, juſtice, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſhould be the plotters; and Honour, and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Actors. A violent humour overthrowes the Maſter. Kings we know are made onely by God, either in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59993:11"/>Juſtice to execute his wrath upon a ſinfull Nation; or in mercy, as well to preſerve and ſet foorth his worſhip and glory, as to maintaine his people in righteouſnes and peace. For neither Royall birth, ſucceſſion, election, uſurpation, conqueſt, nor right, can ſo eſtabliſh, or perpetua to a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; but that God when he pleaſeth, can, and will tranſlate it to others. But now the diſloyall and deceitfull Duke (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as farre from procraſtination, as the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of diſpatch) ſent his Commiſſioners for the recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perfecting of ſuch Articles, as ſhould be propoſed on either ſide. In briefe, they agreed on all points, and aſſigned a day for the young Prince of <hi>Vandoume</hi> to come to the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Court. This being divulged and made knowne to Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> did ſo excutiate all his thoughts, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his perplexed heart, that hee was ready to expoſe himſelfe to all dangers and hazards. In this diſtraction, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova</hi> found him, and knowing the cauſe of his diſtemper (for Rumour had poſſeſt all men with it) hee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, thus ſadly ſaid unto him. Let patience my <hi>Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee out of this ſtormy Sea into a more quiet Port. Fortune ſhould have no power over fortitude and courage What thou never hadſt, that thou doſt not looſe. Thy ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and imparity, could never promiſe thee any hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and thy long nouriſhed diſpairo ſhall now finde a period, that in the end, would have brought thee to thy end. Let neceſſity then make thee now ſuffer conſtantly; and cuſtome will make thy ſufferance eaſie. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> who did heare, but not hearken to what his friend had ſo diſcreetly delivered, regarded him no more then a greedy Lawyer doth his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed Clyent, but ſtill deepely excogitating how hee might intercept, or pervert the intended match, at length he all ſighing ſaid: This Gordian knot muſt be cut a ſunder, though I want an <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſword. Iuduſtry, and Policie, oft effects unlikely things; and we ſhould not judge that which is poſſible, nor that which ſeemes unpoſſible; as it is credible, or incredible to our capacities. The eternall wiſedome hath (I know) a reſerved power, and a ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59993:11"/>to bring things to paſſe, which the wiſedome of man cannot conceive, nor ſee, till it happen, and be done. What though <hi>Vandoume</hi> be mighty? A ſmall Rocke may ruinate a great Ship. I will not ſo looſe <hi>Vienna,</hi> but where I want force to play the Lyon, there will I aſſay to gaine by fraud. <hi>La-nova</hi> he ſaid welcome, thou comeſt in a uſefull time, thou muſt ſecretly fit me with a gray beard, a payre of Beades, a Fryers Gowne, and Hood. I muſt turne Fryer, and Prophet all at once. It muſt be ſo, the plot is layd, and we muſt be Actors both in the play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La-nova,</hi> knowing that his undaunted courage could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brooke a Corrivall, though he were never ſo great, did much feare that he intended ſome ſtraragem, and therefore he told him, that unleſſe he might know his purpoſe, he would make no ſuch proviſion. Why ſaid Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> my thoughts dwell in thy breaſt, and in thy heart, doth my love (next to <hi>Vienna</hi>) live. How then canſt thou be a ſtranger to my purpoſes, that art the Treaſuer of my ſecrets? Thou knoweſt <hi>La-nova</hi> how jealous the <hi>Daulphin</hi> is of his ſafety; His rigorous (I might ſay cruell) Nature hath taught him to feare many, whom many doth ſtill feare. Thou knoweſt alſo that Kings are ever ſuſpitious of their Succeſſours: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience makes them to feare, leaſt they ſhould looſe that which they, and many others ſeeke, with greateſt dangers to obtaine. My project is, to make the King and the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> my inſtruments to breake the marriage; give me Pen, Inke, and Paper, and thou ſhalt ſee what a fearefull fire, I will kindle, to burne up all their matrimoniall hopes and agreements. But to give more life hereunto, thou muſt play thy part. Thy Vnkle is Steward to the Duke of <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doume,</hi> and thou thy ſelfe art gracious in his preſence. To him muſt thou poſt, in ſhew of love to ſee him, and in all duty to tender thy ſervice; And when opportunity ſhall fit thy purpoſe, thou muſt take occaſion to wonder, that ſo great a Prince hath his Armoury ſo ill ſtored, and by way of perſwaſion, thou muſt tell him, that no mans title is ſo right and juſt, but that it may finde worke upon their beſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59993:12"/>advantages, and therefore it is a provident policie for his Highneſſe to be preſently furniſhed for all contingents. This <hi>La-nova,</hi> will ſo feed, and ſway his ambition, that hee will make over-haſty and unadviſed proviſion. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, will ſo prepare and fortifie the Kings jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, that it will crowne my device with beliefe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, <hi>La-nova</hi> glad to ſee him ſo well reſolved, promiſed his beſt endeavours, and in the performance thereof had his wiſhed ſucceſſe. But before he went, he brought Pen, Inke, and Paper, whereupon <hi>Paris</hi> (more Prophetically then he thought) writ as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>When <hi>Vandoumes</hi> firſt borne, ſhall <hi>Vienna</hi> wed,</l>

               <l>Pride ſcornes that time ſhould check <hi>Vandoumes</hi> French Fate,</l>
               <l>Thy death muſt helpe to Crowne his Royall pate.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>La-noua</hi> divining that this procreated conceit, would bring forth ſome good iſſue, could not but laugh thereat; and in that joy, he went immediatly to make proviſion both for himſelfe, and his friend.</p>
            <p>Now each Wedneſday, in every weeke, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> (more for applauſe, then to doe good) received himſelfe (as he went to heare Maſſe) all the Sutors Petitions; and in the afternoone viewed, and conſidered of them. Vpon this day, <hi>Paris</hi> having lapt vp his fraudulent Libell, like a plaine Petition, went to the Court well furniſhed for the purpoſe, where he did ſo well perſonate a holy Fryer, that <hi>Linxes</hi> eyes could not diſcover him. There did he vnſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected deliver it, and returned without perſeverance. Aſterwards the <hi>Daulphin</hi> upon the peruſing of them, found and read (amongſt the reſt) <hi>Paris</hi> his threatning and ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Propheſie, which did ſo poyſon and ſwell him with ſuſpitious thoughts, and moſt fearefull ſurmiſes, that in his irefull indignation, he cryed our with the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> How ſhall we avoid the deepe diſſembling of <hi>Ehud?</hi> Plaine dealing I ſee is dead without iſſue; and all Honour and due
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59993:12"/>reſpects are buried, in the inſatiable deſire of Rule. Surely this is no enigmaticall, nor promiſcuous Oracle, but a plaine prediction ſent by God, or ſome good man in zeale and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Princes, and in tenderneſſe of our ſafeties. O moſt treacherous and perfideous Duke, that in the bonds of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, wouldſt cut off the ſmall remainder of our dayes; to worke thy further bloody ends.</p>
            <p>My daughter ſhall not ſo be Queene by our death; Nor ſhall our Subjects be ſo ſlaine in his unnaturall and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Warre. I will not ſuffer the true Vine to be ſo diſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor ſhall my connivence traduce me for his impunity. For though wiſedome permits not, that I detect him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for feare of making him my implacable enemy; yet will we ſend a private, and an unknowne Meſſenger ſecretly to his King, who ſhall (upon his Royall word for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement of our intelligence) diſcover, and lay open, <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doumes</hi> moſt impious and pernitious intended Treaſon; and after ſhall he caſt (by our inſtructions) ſuch ſtore of oyle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that jealous flame, that it ſhall (at leaſt) burne up all <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doumes</hi> hopes of further proceeding with us. Thus, did ſuch hate proceed from feare that after a ſmall reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee ſent accordingly to the King, who was no ſooner poſſeſt thereof, but that his divided thoughts made ſuch inteſtine warre within his breaſt, that he knew not what to ſay, or doe. His fraternall love made him weepe, to ſee Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo monſtrous and unkinde; and fearefull jealouſies (a diſeaſe incident to Kings) called upon juſtice, and ſayd, that corrected Treaſon was the life of a Prince.</p>
            <p>Diſtruſt now ſtill dreamed upon Murther, and unquier feare could not be ſecured, but with execution: Then Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection tolde him, that then wee come neareſt unto God, when we judge with pitty, and pardon in mercy.</p>
            <p>In this doubtfull Combate of the minde, he ſent for the Duke, who no ſooner came, but that taking him alone into his private Chamber, he with a mild ſeveriy, thus breathed out his griefe, and his juſt and loving rebuke.</p>
            <p>It is our pleaſure <hi>Vandoume</hi> (for ſo thy Soveraigne calls

O with what wonder, did he now obſerve her matchleſſe beauty, her gracefull Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, her pleaſing words, and her ſweet delivery. And what a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59993:14"/>conflict was now growne betwixt his deſire and diſpaire: All his thoughts were extravayant, and at warre with each other. For as deſire did finde content, with joy, to be in her preſence; ſo Diſpaire denyed him all hope, with diſtruſt or any comfort. His heart now began to rebuke his eyes for ſoaring ſo neere the Sunne, and for gazing after impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But his eyes told his heart, that no diſdaine could dwell in ſo rare a perfection. In this perturbation of mind did hee ſtand, untill <hi>Vienna</hi> being dry, called to him for a cup of wine, which he in the pride of that imployment ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily brought, but delivered it with great aſtoniſhment and ſtupidity (as being over-ſurprized both with joy, and feare) he all-ſhaking, flaſht ſome of the wine over the cup, and ſo wet both theyr hands; which one of the Ladies perceiving, ſcornefully ſaid; Sir Knight, you are over-bountifull, I am ſure, my Ladies hand called for no wine. There is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (anſwered <hi>Vienna</hi>) at all; He knew my hand was dry. So Madame, ſaid <hi>Izabella,</hi> is your foot. My foot, ſnee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, is further off from the burning Sunne, and receives moyſture enough from the humide eaith. But neither, ſaid <hi>Izabella,</hi> did neede any wine. We called, ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> for it, being dry; And how could our body receive it, unleſſe our hand had firſt taken it? A dry cup and a cleane hand, ſaid another Lady, had beene more ſerviceable. Why ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> cleane hands are often waſlit, and dry cups quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no thirſt; Then muſt dryneſſe have inoyſture, and hee hath freely given it us: but no more, we have loſt our game in his defence. <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe extaſie had given way to theſe paſſages, recollecting himſelfe, humbly ſaid, What (moſt gracious Princes) you have loſt in the game, that have you wonne by patience in your meekneſſe; but how ſhall I worthily magnifie your great worth, that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe tart Ladies bitter provocations (hath ſhewed the fulneſſe of all vertue in your goodneſſe.

Thankes good Knight, ſayd <hi>Vienna,</hi> we deſire no ſuch ſatisfaction; your taken paines ſhall bee all your puniſhment. <hi>Paris</hi> being proud of this conceited favour, (though <hi>Vienna</hi> in her mild nature pleaded in his defence, onely to croſſe the other Ladies deriſion, and to approve her owne acuteneſſe) withdrew himſelfe to the next window, where with his Diamond hee thus writ.</p>

            <p>Firſt, he commanded that aſolemne and royall Juſts (in honour of the three Ladies) ſhould be proclaimed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Kingdome to be holden in <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Pente coſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, free for all commers, and that ſhe whoſe Knight ſhould honour her, with the honour of the day, ſhould bee ever had, and held, for the faireſt of the three; and that his Queene ſhould crowne her with a Crowne of white Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, beſet with precious ſtones, as Soveraigne Queene of moſt perfect beauty: This milde and pleaſing ſhower, ſo kindly diſtilling from the King, ſo well allayed their ſtormy furies, that calming theyr over-enraged wills, in the ſhame of their amiſſe; they hunibly on bowed knees, craved par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their offences, and thanked the King for the grace and honour that he did them.

And no ſooner where they parted, but <hi>La-nova</hi> departed, to impart to Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> what his noble Father had ſo ſorrowfully ſaid to him: which ſo mooved his feeling conſideration in a Sonnes regard, that partly to ſatisfie his Father from living ſo ſuppoſedly idle, and partly to forget (if ſo he could forget) the tormenting thoughts, that ſtill troubled his enthralled minde.</p>
            <p>He determined to goe (onely with <hi>La-nova</hi>) to the warrs of <hi>Florence.</hi> And craving, he obtained, willing leave of his glad Father; but before his departure, hee called his Mother a ſide, and delivering her the key of his Chamber, and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, wherein were placed all his purchaſt Prizes, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Hangings of sky-coloured ſilke, embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with ſtarres of gold, and ſhaded all over with blacke Cipres, that the dimmeſt eye might perceive the glory of the heavens, through the blackneſſe of the cloud. Her he devoutly requeſted, and humbly conjured (as ſhe tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his contentment, and following welfare) not to ſuffer any to enter therein, nor ſo much as looke therein her ſelfe. This was his requeſt, and this did ſhe proteſt religiouſly to performe: This done, hee craved and received their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſo ſet forwards towards <hi>Florence;</hi> where in briefe; he atchieved ſo great honour in the Dukes Warres, as the bruit of his ſpreading fame, both famed, and inworthied him in the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Court, which much joyed the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> and more rejoyced Sir <hi>Iaques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vienna</hi> all this while grew more penſive, and paſſionate then before, and ſtill (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> longed to know his dreame) ſo deſired ſhee to know, and ſee him whom ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more then her ſelfe, Her veſtall vertue was now no <hi>Diana's</hi> proofe, to withſtand <hi>Vonus</hi> force; nor could her, chaſt conceit diſpence with affectious thoughts. But the more ſhee ſought to quench deſire, the more ſhee burnt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within her owne fire. Many Princes became Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Priſoners to her beauty, and greateſt Barous did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59993:18"/>homage to her vertues; But neyther Prince nor Baron could find favour in Beauty, nor love in vertue. So ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was her ſtrange affection, eſtranged to all but to him that was ſo meere a ſtranger to her ſo flrange a paſſion. To him, and for him, had ſhee conſecrated, and reſerved her devoted heart; and to him, and none but him, would ſhee yeeld the conqueſt of her Maydens minde. And although diſturbed reaſon affoorded her no hope, nor poſſibility of finding of enjoying him; Yet did the gracious aſpect of her favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtarres, yeeld her this meanes to know him. For Sir <hi>Jaques</hi> being greatly viſited with ſickneſſe, was ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bewayled of all, and ſo particularly bemoaned of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> (in regard of his thrige noble ſervice in the wars, and his wiſe directions in Counſell) that he ſent the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinis</hi> his Lady to viſite him; who taking <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Jza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> with her went attended with foure other Ladies, to ſee, and comfort his enfeebled eſtate. But finding him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily amended (after ſome faſhionable, and cheerefull chat:) The <hi>Daulphinis</hi> (led thereto, I know not by what deſteny) was deſirous to ſee hew well the houſe was contrived, how beautified, and how furniſhed; which the good old Lady in all humbleneſſe yeelded unto, conducting them into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, untill they returning, came againe by Sir <hi>Paris</hi> his Chamber doore, which his Mother both going, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming backe, purpoſely paſt by. But being demanded of the <hi>Daulphinis</hi> what Chamber, or Place that was; ſhe durſt not but tell; and telling, would have paſt away, which the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinis</hi> noting, merrily ſayd; Nay Madame, I will not leave the Chamber of ſo worthy a Knight unſeene. The good old Lady not knowing how to avoyd this counterbuffe, fearefully with a trembling hand, opened the doore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were no ſooner entred, but that they ſaw all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Armours, and befitting furnitures for approoved good Knights, which made them commend the owner no little; and to hold him farre worthier of a better Armoury.</p>
            <p>As this they viewed his ſeverall Armours; <hi>Vienna</hi> happily ſixt her eye on a white Armour not farre unlike unto that,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59993:19"/>which Sir <hi>Paris</hi> had on him, when firſt he won her Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and Chriſtall Shield. The ſight whereof, made Hope (the Harbinger of happineſſe) to breath in her this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing comfort; that as that Armour was none but the ſame: So Sir <hi>Paris</hi> (that renowned owner) muſt of neceſſity bee that ſecret Knight, that not daring to be knowne to love her, was (by her ſacred vowes) to bee beloved of her. Thus Hope proſumed the beſt, and invited joy to gratulate her good ſucceſſe. But doubt (curbing raſhneſſe with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration) perſwaded her to further tryall. For as her hope was ready to embrace the firſt ſhew of comfort, ſo was her deſire moſt greedy of more perfect aſſurance. And the better to effect, what ſhe affected, ſhe fayned (and fayne ſhe was to fayne) her ſelfe ſuddenly ſicke, and after ſome ſhew of ſome extremity, ſhe deſired her Mother (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make better ſearch) to leaue her alone, all only with <hi>Izabella,</hi> to reſt her for a time on the bed, which they hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convenient, conſented to it. And no ſooner were they gone, but that <hi>Vienna</hi> bolting the doore, began to make a wary ſearch. At laſt, at the end of the Chamber ſhe found a privie pertition, ſo well ſhadowed with the Hangings of the Chamber, that hardly could any perceive the ſame; within, and behind this, was the place wherein Sir <hi>Paris</hi> daily, ſacrificed his prayers vnto his God, wherein they were no ſooner entred, but that withdrawing a glorious clouding Curtaine, they diſcovered the three famous rich Prizes of Sir <hi>Paris</hi> victorious prowis, ſtately erected vpon the wall, and below them hanged the Chriſtall Shield, and golden Chaplet, he firſt wonne at her Fathers Court.

Long looked <hi>Vienna</hi> on euery ſeverall Prize, but longer looked ſhee on both the Armours; now bluſhing and ſighing; then liniling and wondring at the ſtately and pleaſing proportion of them, In this contentment, and admiration of her thoughts, ſhee

Theſe Verſes well pleaſed <hi>Vienna,</hi> and all contentment now waited on her firſt liking conceit: But after ſhee had more conſideratively weyed how poore Sir <hi>Paris</hi> was, that meane Man whom ſhe wiſht ſo much to ſee, and to whom ſhe had devoted the honour of her love; her bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſhfulneſſe then rebak't her miſliked kindneſſe, and his muddy clouded affection, ecclipſed the ſun-ſhine of her far more glorious worth. In this diſlike, ſhe ſilent ſate her downe, and riſing ſtreight againe ſayd; That promiſe is nefarious, that is to be accompliſhed by an ignoble deed; and it is more tollerable to violate an vnworthy vow foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly made; then by keeping the ſame, to draw on my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gtace, and give juſt cauſe of offence to others: My fayth falls out a treaſon to my ſelfe, and the love I beare him, is the ſield wherein I ſeeke to overthrow my renowne: But why ſhould my raſh judgement ſet a ranckling tooth in his vertuous ſide? Or why ſhould I care for more honours then to content my ſelfe; Or for more riches, then to enjoy my ſelfe? Wee are all borne to love; and wee onely live, and love to be beloved: Then not to love, and thinke to be beloved, is like that fooliſh Virgin, that ſought to light her Lampe at anothers Torch that was quite extinct. With that ſhe began to recount the ſhining Glory of his ſpreading renowne, the full perfection of his many appro o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and admired vertues; the commendable regard of his ſecret and impriſoned love, with the dangerous and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable approbation of the ſame; and how ſhe was bound in honor to honor and love him, that had above the pride of all honour, ſo honorred her. Then, then began ſhee to be more ſorry ſhe could love him no better; then before ſhe was aſhamed ſhe loved him ſo well: And therefore taking <hi>Jzabella</hi> by the hand, ſhe vowed and ſwore, that ſhe would live to love none but Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> not love to live longer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will you then loſe an honour for an humour? Nay, rather performe a Regall office in a Prince-like nature; that being a Princeſſe in your ſelfe, become alſo Prince-like in your deeds. What will your Father ſay, nay all <hi>France,</hi> nay all the world? when they ſhall heare that <hi>Vienna,</hi> late ſcorning the Royall love of greateſt Princes, is now ſubjected to the will of a meane Knight: Farre be it from my Lady ſo to doe, farre from any to thinke ſo, and farre from <hi>Izabella</hi> ever to ſee it ſo.</p>

And therefore pleaſed, to adventure his Fortune upon the rocke of this hazard, hee ſhewed no further miſlike that hee miſt them.

In the morning, their earely deſires ſo haſtened their ſpeedy departures that being timely up, and quickly horſed, Sir <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>La Mois,</hi> rude apace before, to view the River, whoſe over-flowed bankes were ſo over-runne, by the pride of a late ſwelling flood, that the Foard was not paſſable, which made Sir <hi>Paris</hi> ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, ſo to bee fraſtrated of his attending Ship (the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Uſery) that <hi>Monſiour de la Mort</hi> over venturous

Sir <hi>Paris</hi> daunted at that ſo fatall a ſight, ſighed, and ſighing, grew to a prodigious Prognoſticator of his owne enſuing harmes. But fearing leaſt the knowledge thereof might appale his faire Friend, hee ſuddainly returned to their religious Hoſt, where hee had left the two Ladyes, when he went to find the Foard, and to try the paſſage; and ſhadowing now his tormenting griefe with a forced ſmile, hee demaunded of <hi>Vienna</hi> how ſhee fared, who anſwered, as my Love fares, ſo fares thy Love, happie in my ſelfe; becauſe happie in thee. And long may (ſayd <hi>Paris</hi>) my Love live to love, that loves to live onely for my love. Scarce had Sir <hi>Paris</hi> pronounced his laſt word, when one came running to tell the Prieſt, that there were many Knights in he next Towne, that came in queſt; and ſearched for <hi>Vienna</hi> and Sir <hi>Paris:</hi> Which <hi>Vienna</hi> underſtanding, was ſo ſurprized with griefe and feare, that being altogether diſheartned in her hope, ſhee held her ſelfe more than undone in her diſturbed expectation: But after ſhe had bathed the beauty of her eyes, in the ſorrow of of her teares, fearing moſt in this preſent perill, leaſt death ſhould arreſt her beloved Friend: She with a much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved mind, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Load not my ſorrowes with thy griefe, nor kill thou thy ſelfe, for feare of death; But in the wonted courage of thy never-daunted Spirit, get thee to ſome other more ſafer ſhore; where let Vertue hee thy Governour, my remembrance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59993:25"/>thy Love; thy loue my comfort, and my comfort thy ſole contentment. Thou haſt conquered men in loue, and Loue in me; and both in worth and wiſedome; and never ſhall I deeme my ſelfe happy, but when I ſhall ſee thee happy, for whom I now am ſo vnhappy: As thou leaveſt me, ſo ſhalt thou finde me; be but thou as conſtant a Friend to my Minde, as thou ſhalt be a Poſſeſſor of my Heart; and I ſhall have as much cauſe of joy, as thou no cauſe of doubt. If thou continue loyall, ſucceſſe (thou ſhalt ſee) will bleſſe thee well, and all good fortune will waite on thy juſt merits. This Diamond which here I giue thee ſhall be a true remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning record of my ſincere loue to thee: Onely, let me heare of thy aboad; and ſo I leaue thee to the guide of Vertue, and ſeruice of Fortune. Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thus diſcomforted, comforted; weighing the danger of delay, by his imminent perill, and forced to ſet vp his ſayles in this ſo inſupportable and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a tempeſt; and there ſealing vp the vow of his faith, in the ſilent griefe of a departing kiſſe, he poſted to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſide againe; where Diſpaire made Feare ſo valiant, that ere he found cauſe of feare, hee was paſt all feare: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paſt he knew not how the River, he was got before he wiſt into the Ship: wherein being Cabined, hee told of <hi>La Mot</hi> his fatall accident, and forced them to put to ſea, ſayling himſelfe with as many contrary thoughts, as <hi>Eolus</hi> ſent out windes vpon the Trojan Fleet: At length he arrived at <hi>Genoa,</hi> where he reſted his reſtleſſe ſelfe, and where he liued, wanting but little, becauſe not deſiring much. But ſuch was his diſconſolate ſolitary life, that the Citizens (though ſtrangers) affecting the man in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, pittied much his diſtreſſe, in the ſhew of his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. In the meane while, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> waſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in his owne implacable, and vnlimited wrath, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and ſuddainly ſeazed, and confiſcated, all Sir <hi>Iaques</hi> Lands and Goods into his hands; Impriſoning both him, and his Lady, as Fauters, Abetters, Confederates, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juters thereunto. Thus gets Outrage, ever the ſharpeſt edge upon the firſt advantage; And in this diſtemper of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59993:26"/>his ill diſpoſed minde, he commanded that naught but bread and water ſhould be giuen them. For, ſaid he, where the offence is greater then the ſervice, there Iuſtice chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the bond of recompence into due puniſhment. During this their faultleſſe impriſonment, the queſting Knights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Hoſpitalious Parſon, her Hoſt; who being brought before the angry <hi>Daulphin</hi> (her enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Father) ſhee ſaw the cloud a farre off, before the ſtorme fell, and therefore proſtrating her ſelfe at his Feete, ſhee required pardon for her offence, and prayed that he would not make her ſinne deadly, which was but veniall; pleading ignorance for the Prelate, and vnreſiſtable loue for her ſelfe; ſwearing and aſſuring him, by ſacrament of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath, and the teſtimonie of her Hoſt, that ſhee was as honeſt in her flight, as ſhe was in her birth, and that her vnſpotted thoughts were neuer ſtayned, with any vnchaſt deed or deſire. The noble followers of the obdurate <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> ſeeing the Princeſſe waſhing her repentance in her owne teares, humbly beſought him to forget, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue her amiſſe, ſince the frailty of her offence, was rather a ſore, then a ſinne; and wounds were to be healed and not hurt.

            <p>Now Sir <hi>Paris</hi> had not long ſojourned in <hi>Genoa,</hi> but that mindfull of his charge; he writ to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and encloſed it in another writ to <hi>La-nova,</hi> wherein hee excuſed his vnkind departure without his priuity, and conjured him by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred lawes of true amity; to attend and follow his Lady, in all ſeruice and faſt friendſhip. <hi>La-nova</hi> glad of ſuch glad

To maintaine which, ſhe delivered to <hi>La-nova</hi> tenne thouſand Crownes, which he ſent immediately: Sir <hi>Paris</hi> receiving now ſo pleaſing a pledge of her perſevered conſtancie, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed no little in her ſo agreeable affection. And as ſhe required, ſo ſet hee up the maine ſayle of his obſcured glory in the wind of her will, by taking a great houſe, and by maintaining ſo great a Port, that his Majeſticall magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity well manifeſted, that his former ſiniſter fortune was nothing ſuteable to his birth and education.</p>
            <p>Whiles Sir <hi>Paris</hi> thus Courted it out in ſome content, <hi>Vienna</hi> was ſolicited by many great Lords. But the ſeed which they ſowed in the ſands, was waſht away with the firſt flood of the Tyde; ſo that all their hoped Harveſts, was nought but crops of growing cares. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> (whoſe climing thoughts looked ever upon greateſt ſtarres) kept the beame of her ballance ſtraight, without gaine-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sutor, or diſgracing that. But to prevent all diſtaſte that might come by deniall, he ſpeedily ſent ſpeciall Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59993:27"/>to his faſt friend, the Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> requeſting his beſt labours and endeavours, to move, and make (if ſo he might) a marriage, betwixt his daughter <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> his ſonne. Such was his couetous deſire, in lieu of the <hi>Burbons</hi> poſſeſſions, not to be valued; and ſuch his conceit of his ſonnes valour, not then (as hee thought) to be equalled; ſo as his pride, could, nor would, admit of any other ſonne in law, but this great and matchleſſe Prince. The Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> glad that occaſion offered it ſelfe, that he might both gratifie the <hi>Daulphin</hi> his friend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt himſelfe in the loue and greatneſſe of the <hi>Burbon</hi> Duke, which he had long deſired; was now as willing as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, that is euer ready to pleaſure another, to profit him ſelfe. And knowing, that he that ſleepeth, catcheth no Fiſh; he went inſtantly to the Duke, who no ſooner heard of the motion, but glorying in the hope of ſuch vnexpected advancement, he entertained the Earle with all the ſtate, that either greatneſſe could performe, or deſire require. In concluſion, the <hi>Burbon</hi> Duke ſent his ſonne, in the greateſt pride of proudeſt ſtate, to the <hi>Daulphins</hi> Court, where he did proportion his carriage anſwerable to the eminencie of his place; his merits being ſuch, and ſo many, that (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely aſide his pride of heart) <hi>Envie</hi> her ſelfe, could not detract from his worth. But before he came to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> hearing of his neere approach, went to his daughter, and told her what tender care he had of her good, how hee had laboured to make the <hi>Burbon</hi> Prince, her glorious Groome. and how happy ſhe might thinke her ſelfe, to bee beſtowed on ſo great and famous a Lord. One, whom the world admires for his heroicall fortitude; feares of his greatneſſe; and loues for his deſerts. A Prince incomparable by title and birth: A perſon beautified by Nature; And a man inricht with wiſedome, wealth, and worthineſſe. Then let my Choyſe be thy content, and in thy full conſent ſee that thou entertaine him with all vertuous favours. This ſaid, he commanded to horſe, not ſtaying her anſwer, and ſo rid forth royally attended, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59993:28"/>appointed, to receiue the young Prince. And farre he had not rid, but that he met, and encountred with his long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and now expected gheſt. The young Prince firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting from his Horſe, gaue the <hi>Daulphin</hi> occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount himſelfe, who being on foote, ſtayed till the Prince came unto him; where they greeted, re-greeted, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other, and then remounting themſelves, they rid Marſhalled in right good equipage to the Pallace, where all the Ladies (ſaving <hi>Vienna</hi>) gave a ſecond ſalute, to the greater content of the <hi>Burbon</hi> Prince. But the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> miſſing <hi>Vienna,</hi> miſliked much her abſence, yet ſeemed to take no notice of it, but ſmoothing the angry furrowes of his diſcontentment, he (with an inforced cheerefulnes) brought the Prince to his lodging, and there leaving him to his private repoſe; hee haſtily went to <hi>Viennas</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where all ſad, and ſolitary, he found her ſitting in the ſeate of ſorrow, or rather in the ſhade of death, for feare of her fathers provoked ire; whoſe violent, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſpoſition, would (ſhe knew) tranſport him beyond all the bounds of Natures tenderneſſe. Of her, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, why contrary to his command, ſhee had abſented her ſelfe in the requiſite entertainement of ſo great a Lord, and ſo worthy a friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vienna</hi> riſing from her ſorrowfull ſeate, but not from her ſorrow, with fearefull erected hands, and pitty plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes, humbled her ſelfe at his feete, and told him, that for ſhame of her firſt flying fault, ſhe had vowed her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity to <hi>Diana;</hi> and ſworne her ſelfe, a Veſtall, to <hi>Veſta.</hi> And therefore had ſhe ſo ſeparated her ſelfe a ſide, becauſe ſhe would not give fire to his fancie, nor wrong his better deſerts with forlorne deſires. In conſideration whereof ſhe humbly prayed, that none but her ſelfe might enioy her ſelfe, ſince none but her ſelfe could, or ſhould content her ſelfe. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> perceiving light though a ſmall crevis, began in milde pollicy, by gentle entreaties, and rich perſwaſions, to weane her from her will; telling her, that vnlawfull vowes were to be violated; ſince the firſt cauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59993:28"/>ceaſing and a new ſucceeding, both might be altered; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſhe any ſuch power in her ſelfe, that was not to be diſpoſed of by a Father; And to honour, and obey Parents. is the firſt Commandement that hath any reward promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on earth. Beſides, it is an enuious wrong to Nature, to ſuffer her faireſt worke (like a ſweet fragrant odoriferous Roſe) to dye upon the ſtocke; that being pluckt in the bloome, might yeeld both pleaſure, and profit to others: therefore renounce this beliefe, if thou meaneſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or to haue any fauour. For by courſe of kinde all thinges were made to increaſe; and by increaſe to benefit another; and ſhe is a Divell amongſt men, that profiteth no man. This did the <hi>Daulphin</hi> thinke by his ſmooth words, to build a Caſtle in the ayre, that had no hope of foundation on the earth. For <hi>Viennas</hi> vnremoueable reſolution, being bent to ſhoote at her firſt marke, could not be wonne to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell at another ayme; which made the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> (failing (like a Foxe) to deceiue with kindneſſe) to play now the Lyon by compulſion; And therefore gnaſhing his teeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for anger (like the Sea that waxeth mad, when the windes doe rage) he commanded both her and <hi>Izabella</hi> to cloſe priſon.</p>
            <p>The young Prince meruailing beyond all meaſure, that he could not ſee amiable <hi>Vienna,</hi> the eye of <hi>France,</hi> the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of her ſex, the wonder of time, and the pride of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; demanded of her Father, what ominous cloud ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the brightneſſe of <hi>France</hi> his ſecond Sunne, that ſhe appeared not in her all-admired glory. The <hi>Daulphin</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt he ſhould diſtaſt the Prince, by vnderſtanding the matter; framed, and faigned this excuſe. That ſickneſſe had attached her, and made her a priſoner to her bed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed his patience a while, till her hoped recouery might better pleaſe his fancy. The young Prince holding his words for Oracles, held himſelfe contented, and thought to weare and weary out the wearineſſe of time, with other Courtly, and more Knightly ſports; wherein hee was ſo fortunate, that <hi>Fame</hi> was the Herauld of his Heroicall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59993:29"/>deedes This did ſo enflame the love of the <hi>Daulphin</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that no eye-water could ever after quench the ſame; Deſert did now double his deſire; and his deſire had no end, in gayning his daughters conſent, which he againe now vainely laboured: Sometimes laying before her the Riches, Glory, and Dignities of <hi>Iuno:</hi> ſometimes painting forth the Honour, Reſpect, and Happineſſe, ſhee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by ſuch another <hi>Hector;</hi> and then pleading the ſweet content, that growes by enjoying ſo pleaſing and compleat a Prince. But when he found his waſted wordes dye in their owne ſound, and all his hopes vtterly ſhip-wrackt; his better conſideration was then forfeited further to hate, and rancour; then either nature, or pitty, could redeeme it. Then began he to thunder out fearefull threats, cruell chaſtiſements, and moſt inſupportable miſeries. Commanding the Keeper (in his ouer-awfull juſtice) that ſad ſolitarineſſe ſhould onely attend her impriſonment, and that eager hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould daily waite on her Table, and ſo he departed, hopeleſſe of reclayming her, and therefore reſolued to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten her obſtinacie, with all ſeverity. But
<q>
                  <l>No force, can Fancie force; nor croſſes Love expell,</l>
                  <l>For Rivers ſtopt, above their bankes, will higher ſwell.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The young Prince hauing now-ſpent many dayes, and not ſeene her, whom onely he came to viſite; importuned the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that he might but viſite her both to comfort her in her malady, and ſomewhat to ſatisfie his ſtarved eyes, in their more then greedy deſires. But the doubling <hi>Dalphin</hi> pleaded her miſlike ſo to be ſeene; aſſuring him, that ſhee daily requeſted, that he (whom ſhe onely vpon ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port entirely affected (ſhould not in any caſe ſee her ſo ſore impaired. So great (ſaid hee) is her care to ſeeme pleaſing unto you, ſuch her ſhamefaſtneſſe at firſt ſo to bee ſeene of you. And therefore let me entreat your further patience, for your willing returne, vntill her better health, may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter countervalle your taken paines; which once recovered,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59993:29"/>you ſhall be ſpeedily informed. In the meane time ſalute in my name, your thrice noble royall Father, and tell him, that J hold my ſelfe ſo much honoured, in his deſired affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that my ſelfe, and what is the <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> reſts wholly at his pleaſure: and further, pray him that the lawfull cauſe of this unwilling ſtay; may ſtand for ſatisfaction till better payment. The young Prince thus ſmoothed up with words of faireſt dye, held himſelfe well appeaſed, though not throughly pleaſed; and holding the <hi>Daulphins</hi> words for written verity, hee implored the firme continuance of his found favours, and proteſted kindneſſes; and ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe to the good grace of his adored Lady; he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and friendly tooke his leave, and returned to <hi>Burbon.</hi> The Prince departed: The <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who had no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce then the cruell Judge hath mercy; gave in charge, that no one ſhould viſite, or repaire to his Daughter, but onely <hi>Mounſieur Maux,</hi> a right Saturniſt by nature, and an unrelenting Tyrant in life; him hee commanded (under paine of death) to give her nothing but Bread, and the worſt wine, twice a day; which this enemy of vertue, and ſtaine of all mankind, ſo barbarouſly performed, that his cruell uſage too ſoone impared poore <hi>Vienna,</hi> and diſtreſſed <hi>Izabella,</hi> who had unkindly; and untimely pined; and periſhed in that loathſome ſolitary Priſon, had not <hi>La-nova</hi> found out a meanes (as hereafter ſhall bee ſhowne) to ſuccour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> who had many times waſhed her aged face in the teares of her conſuming griefe for her afflicted Child, having neither knowledge of any meanes to relieve her, nor hope of her delivery: knowing the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> to be as reſolute in his rigur, as he was abſolute in opinion: Adviſed with her neareſt friends, and obliged dependants, what was to be done in ſo deſperate and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a caſe. Where by the concurrance of adviſes, it was concluded, that ſhe ſhould ſend unto the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle, there to learne what ſhould be done, and become of her enthralled Daughter. This Counſell being imbraced, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59993:30"/>the journey undertaken, the winds gave ſpeed, and the Meſſenger arrived at <hi>Delphar,</hi> where after all Ceremonies were religiouſly performed, hee received a ſcrowle to carry unto the <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> with charge not to looke therein. The <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> whoſe feare made her thinke all good to be too good for her; thought yet each houre an age, till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: Misfortune ſo blindeth thoſe, wee will overthrow, as that ſhe gives their deſires wings to draw on; and haſten their owne decayes. At laſt hee came, and humbly delivered the ſcrowle, importing this much.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Daulphinis,</hi> whoſe ever ſad ſurcharged heart was unable to diſgeſt ſuch heavie and bitter Cates; found this ſawce too ſharpe for her dyet. For it was no ſooner read, but that finding (as ſhe thought) all the gates of comfort ſhut up with vntricate threats and impoſſibilities, (being too weake a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſtell (to beare ſo ſharpe a liquor) ſhe ſhrunke under the weight of her ſad burthen, and fell ſuddenly dead; and ſo left the <hi>Daulphin</hi> a eruell Father, and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Widower.</p>
            <p>This mournfull accident rather exaſperated his irefull diſpleaſure towards his Daughter (in making her diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the originall cauſe of her death) then in any wiſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated his execrable reſolution, againſt her determined en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance. But hee had not lived many dayes in dolour, but that burying the remembrance of his deareſt Spouſe, in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59993:30"/>hope of future happineſſe; his obdurate heart became as unſenceable of her loſſe, as of his Daughters miſery. Love found love, and the madneſſe of age made him ſuch a ſlave unto his ſlave, that before one yeares period, he married one of his Wives meaneſt Attendants; One (who knowing her owne unworthineſſe,) having neither Vertue to ſtrengthen her fortune, nor good nature to incite her to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or goodneſſe, nor any merit to winne applauſe was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo potent over him, that ſhe guided the ſterne of his flinty and unpennitrable heart: And though ſhe feared the ſcorne of abject baſeneſſe, yet to maintaine the ſtolne pride of her enhanſed heart, ſhee cunningly gave fewell to her Husbands enraged will, and covertly blew ſtill the coales of his diſpleaſure. For feare ſhee did leaſt that her Daughters liberty ſhould (in the aſpect of true honour) could both her ſwelling conceited glory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from her proud inſulting greatneſſe: To fruſtrate which, ſhe cautely one day, leaning on his breſt, and ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his froſted beard, thus ſadly ſayd.</p>
            <p>When (my deereſt Lord) I looke upon the breach of the Princeſſe, your Daughters obligation; I finde the penaltie you take, to be moſt juſt (though ſevere;) Since the juſt Judger of all, did for the ſole diſobedience of onely one, caſt both him, and all his Poſteritie out of Paradice: How like unto him you ſhew your ſelfe herein, your unpartiall Juſtice well demonſtrates, who rightfully puniſheth the ſinne of diſobedience in your owne members, as God did in his owne creatures. Juſtice is the badge of vertue, the ſtate of peace, and maintenance of honour; and the will of a Father ſhould be a religious law unto the Child: And they that preferre theyr owne luſtes before theyr Parents pleaſures, looſeth the benefit both of natures right, and a Fathers regard: For reaſon would not we ſhould reſpect thoſe that forſake us: The Husband man cuttes and loppes off all unkindly Branches from the good Vine: <hi>Iove</hi> held his Children part of his ſubſtance, of whom hee did and might diſpoſe; and the noble <hi>Romans</hi> deprived their Sonnes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59993:31"/>of life, that infringed but theyr commaunds. I alleadge not this (moſt worthy Lord) to aggravate your Daughters foule offence, whoſe other deſerts I honour, whoſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare I affect, and whoſe merited puniſhment I condole; Nor yet to detract from the worth of your thrice worthy chaſticement, which all men commend, and juſtice allowes. But feare (of I know what) and the love of your ſafety enforceth me in love and duty, to manifeſt what I feare, and to prevent what I doubt. <hi>Vienna</hi> (you know) my endeered Lady, is the immediate apparent Heyre to this Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the unjuſt deſires that waite upon a Crowne, begets oft moſt inhumane, unnaturall, and unlawfull Acts: Nature in that expectation, looſeth her ſight. Vertue her ſtrength, Dutie her obedience, and Love her reſpect: Nothing can out-ballance ambitious deſire, either in the reach of dignity, or revenge; Nor is there any limitation in the adventurers. Her reſtraint is (I feare) like fire raked up in embers, that covertly will kindle, and openly burſt foorth into a flame; For the harder ſhe deemes her ſelfe handled, the more will ſhe ſeeke after her releaſe, if not after revenge; Nor can ſhe want inſtigators thereunto: Since all men like and preferre the ryſing of the Moone before the ſetting of the Sunne: And to win advancement in that hope they will contrive; practiſe, and execute whatſoever, and howſoever: Such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions gives fire to corrupt Humoriſts; and ſuch grounds ſets repugnant Malecontents a worke. I would my death might free you from ſuch dangerous intendments, or that my life could acquit you from ſuch heavie accidents.

Thus to nouriſh debate, after ſhe had fedde on ſlander, and inſtil'd in his eates a fearefull jealouſie, which over-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous mindes eaſily apprehends, and covetouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. The better to acquit her ſelfe from all ſuppoſe of malice or detraction: She weeping, told him, That the night before, her Mothers Ghoſt appeared unto her, all in white, her unſmoothed haire diſplayed about her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. her ruefull falne face pale, her eyes hollow, and in eyther hand a Taper burning dimme; which ſo affrighted her, that had ſhe not comfortably ſpoken to me, when I had no power to call to you; I had awaked you, and cryed for helpe: But ſodainely, with a feeble voyce, ſhe mildly ſaid; Feare not my Daughter, to looke upon thy Mothers harmeleſſe Ghoſt, who in tender care of thee, and eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, have left my bed of reſt, to come to premoniſh thee of your enſuing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With that ſhe gave a wimpe, darkeneſſe poſſeſt the place, and I lay wounded and affrighted with remembrance, both of her ſight and of her words. This Appariſion, the happy Angell of our God, (for viſions are cleere revelations, where dreames are but deluſions) hath moved me, out of an affectionate feare of you, to deliver what I ſaw, heard, and have ſaid; which otherwiſe in my love to your Princely Daughter, I would willingly have concealed. And therewithall ſhe wept againe; and kiſſing him ſaid, O hardeſt of happes, but moſt unhappy onely I, that ſhe, to whom I owe all love, and from whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withdraw my devoted affections, ſhould by my meanes be the more afflicted. But in my Lords love and welfare, doe I onely live, and will bury all other affects and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

If ſo, ſay ſo, and tell me, how thou cam'ſt hither. For J wonder at thy preſence, and feare thy hazard. Your Knight (moſt conſtantly (vertuous, and renowned Lady) ſaid <hi>La-nova</hi>) lives I hope, and no doubt wholly yours: But never ſince the receite of this Letter, heard I any tydings of him. Onely my care of your good (the ſumme of Sir <hi>Paris</hi> charge) hath plotted, and effected, this poore ſhift, to relieve and comfort your grace. And ſo he told her how, and ſhewed her the way, the top where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he adviſed her to cover well, leaſt it ſhould be diſcryed, he undone and ſhe unſuccoured. <hi>Vienna</hi> re-embracing him for his kinde and tender regard to her, and for his true, and faſt love to them both; gave him many thankes, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated him, to make privie enquiry of the <hi>Genua</hi> Merchants, whether they knew, or had heard of Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and how he ſpent his dayes and ſo fearing the deteſted Keepers comming. <hi>La-nava</hi> left her, to make proviſion for her.</p>

To give peace vnto theſe his diſturbed thoughts, he went unto the Caſtle to ſee whether that weakening dyet, and tedious thraldome, had well reduced her ſeduced minde; and made her of a diſobedient childe, the daughter of his will.

            <p>By this time, the Moone ſeven times had ſhowne her ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt face, and as many times loſt the ſplendor of her light. When the Prince of <hi>Burbon,</hi> deſirous to ſee the Emperious Miſtreſſe of his enthralled heart, taking humble leave of his Father, ſecretly poaſted to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the <hi>Daulphin</hi> enknowledged of his comming, went to receive him at his outermoſt gate.

The <hi>Daulphin</hi> (whoſe ſences held now a Synode) was driven to ſuch a exigent, that not knowing how to avoyde the Cheque without a Mate, he was perforce forced to confeſſe the trueth. So that taking him aſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ſwore by Sacrament of ſolemne Oath, that his

            <p>The young Prince aſtoniſhed at the ſtrangeneſſe of the caſe, wondred greatly at the cauſe: Yet flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with ſelfe-conceite of his worthy worthyneſſe; He earneſtly intreated the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> that he might make ſome tryall, what himſelfe could doe for himſelfe.

            <p>The young Prince (whoſe liſtening eares, were well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſweet harmony of her well tuned words; and whoſe liking Eyes, were raviſlied with the ſight of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections) was ſo perplexed betwixt new conceived deſires, and diſdaine to bee diſdained; that not knowing what to ſay, hee ſtood like one that had loſt himſelfe; not reall in ſence, but as a faire Flower, nipt with the morning froſt, hanging downe his head, as moſt ſorry, for his declining glory: In this diſpaire, the remembrance of his owne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the conceit of his owne merits, gave ſuch quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning life to his mortified thoughts, and ſuch freedome to his impriſoned tongue, that boldly, and plainely, hee told her, who hee was, why, and for what he came. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> pleading ignorance for the errour of her careleſſe regard, humbled her ſelfe, with thankfull acknowledgement of his more worthy worthineſſe: But ſuch (ſayd ſhe) is the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of my decreed chaſtity, that nought but death ſhall breake the bond.</p>
            <p>Why Madame (replyed the Prince) in ſo doing, you wrong Nature, in clouding the brightneſſe of her Suone, deprive the world of more glorious light, neglect your duty, in diſaſſenting from your Fathers will, wound my deſires with forlorne hopes, and rob your ſelfe, both of propagating plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſweeteſt content, and greateſt glory: Then leave theſe injurious walls, and change your Priſon (unfitting your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) for a Pallace prepared for a Princeſſe; In aſſurance whereof, accept moſt renowned Lady, this pledge of my Faith, wherein is charactered the Life of my Love, and the Love of my Soule; and therewith,

Then let your owne guift (replyed the Prince) make you a Queene, and me your ſlave. My foruines (ſayd <hi>Vieuna</hi>) admits of no ſuch Soveraignty; and your Greatneſſe is too potent for a Vaſſaile. J am too poore to give; and it ſtands not with a Lord to begge; then be you ſtill a King in your owne thoughts, and I will reſt content with my Fate. Why, Kings (anſwered the Prince) have no priviledge in Love: and the Gods themſelves were ſubject to beauty. <hi>Vieuna</hi> conſtant in her chaſte pretence, ſeeing his earneſt proſecution, and being wearied with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, becauſe loathing ſuch conference, held it good pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to prevent his further importunity. And therefore ſhe briefely and plainely told him, that ſhe way not for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor his honour of her humour. For know (ſhee wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſaid.) that the long cold and grievous impriſonment, which indurable.

The enſlamed Prince, thus cooled in his hot purſuites, found his thoughts now freer from affection, then hee deemed his body ſound from infection.

The Faulkener admiring at his skill (for ignorance is the mother of admiration) in the joy of his thoughts, went and brought his recovered Hawke unto <hi>Solimon,</hi> and recounted unto him; how that a ſtranger, an <hi>Athiopian</hi> borne, that called himſelfe <hi>Sirap,</hi> had effected that cunning Cure; and that he was a man ſo exquiſite in all proportion, and of ſo goodly and Majeſticall a preſence, that hee ſeemed not onely to bee of an Heroicall heart, but alſo promiſed more then was uſually in a man.

On his Shield hee had a Ship, ſtayed (in the midſt of a Sea) by a little Fiſh, called <hi>Remora;</hi> and his impreſſe was, <hi>Vertue, not force.</hi> As thus hee ſtood looking for entrance, The appointed Officers, demaunded what he was, and wherefore hee came, who anſwered, that he was a Man of peace, a devout Hermite, and one of the leaſt of the moſt humbleſt Servants of Great <hi>Solimon;</hi> Who for the love of Honour, and to honour his Lord, came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove that the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Turkie,</hi> was a greater and a more Emperiall, and a more magnificant Monarch, then the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Emperour, and much more renowned in his perſon; And that <hi>Turbulents</hi> ſhämefull, and criminall offence, was puniſhable (by all Nationall lawes) where the fault was committed; and this he would make good on his body, and deſired to enter the Lyks. Vpon this, all the Turkes gave a great ſhowt, and cryed God, and <hi>Mahamet</hi> for the <hi>Hermit:</hi> And ſo putting up his Sword, hee was conducted by one of the <hi>Bacſhaes</hi> to the other end of the Lyſts, where diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe, hee was ſeated in a rich Chayre of State, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought with halfe Moones in ſilver, and ſet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones.

But adviſed experience, and wary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, which had ever arm'd the <hi>Hermit</hi> for all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and aſſaults, made him unwilling of ſuch unkind embracement: And therefore made ſtopage by a moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate thruſt, which finding entrance under his bruiſed Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, runne upwards and made quicke inquiſition after his death.

But when <hi>Solimon</hi> ſaw that he was <hi>Sirap,</hi> his neer affected and entertained friend, laying aſide all State and regard of greatneſſe, he came to him, and embracing him, ſaid: How ſhall the Turkiſh <hi>Sultan</hi> requite the honourable love of ſo praiſe-worthy a friend, but in the renowned hazard of his invaluable life, hath both preſerved, and dignified my name, and the fame of my Empire. But more bentting times ſhall ſhew us reſpectfully gratefull, and affectionately mindfull, of ſo vertuous a friend, ſo famous a Champion, and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an act. In the interim, hee commanded that three of his chiefe <hi>Baſhaes</hi> ſhould ride before <hi>Sirap,</hi> and that the firſt ſhould carry the <hi>Tartars</hi> louped arme and Sword: the ſecond his unweldy Speare, and maſſie Shield; and the third, his grim and terrible ſevered Head; and that after ſhould follow the monſtrous and headleſſe trunke of that huge boaſting <hi>Goliah;</hi> after whom would march the diſgraced Ambaſſadour, and all his diſcontented traine: And that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rap</hi> mounted on his Courſer, all alone, with his naked blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſword in his hand, like a Conquerour ſhould follow; and after him, he himſelfe, the <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> and all his royall Attendants ſhould ride, and ſo paſſe through the City, to his Pallace. This he did to honour his friend; And out of this honour, did <hi>Fugenia</hi> his <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> more affectionately looke upon the merit of <hi>Sirap.</hi> His carriage ſeemed now more majeſticall; his colour though blacke, ſhee deemed lovely; and the nobleneſſe of his ſpirit, deſerved (ſhee thought) the favour of the greateſt Empreſſe. This liking begot longing, and ſhe deſired how to enjoy, what ſhe was enjoyned not to affect. The remembrance of her place, and the terrour of their law, qualified, but not quench'd her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59993:45"/>ſired fancie; which ſhe ſeeking to ſmother in the embers, burſt out after into a greater, and more ſhamefull flame.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sirap,</hi> during his repoſe, for the healing of his wounds, entering into conſideration of his croſſe fortunes, ſeeing his admired victories applauded with open joyes, honour, and tryumphes; and his dejected and enthralled heart, ſtill clad in blacke woe, and accompanyed onely with ſecret griefe, and tormenting paſſions. To feed his diſtaſte of rejoycing, with ſome ſad conceites.

            </q>
            <p>Thus did he ſhewe himſelfe to be ever one, as conſtant in his woes as he was unremoveable in his love; And thus ever in his houres of leaſure, did either his tongue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, or his penne manifeſt his ſorrow. But when loathed time had healed his honoured wounds. The grand <hi>Sultan</hi> to give his ſolitarineſſe ſome ſollace, ſent unto him, that the next day hee ſhould be in befitting readineſſe to attend him to the chaſe of the wilde Boare, in the neere adjoyning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; And commanded one of his <hi>Basſhaes</hi> to ſee that <hi>Sirap</hi> ſhould be well mounted, and furniſhed accordingly. For ſtill it bare him in minde (ſeeing the map of Majeſty in his eyes, and finding the vertue of true Nobility in his thoughts) that he was extract from Royall bloud; And by this meanes, hee thought he ſhould (by his obſervance) make a further tryall thereof. The next morning <hi>Phoebus</hi> had no ſooner rent the ſable Clouds, and waſh'd his face with the dew of the earth, but that the winding of baſe and bugle hornes,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59993:46"/>ſummoned the <hi>Sultan</hi> to his Silvan ſports, and <hi>Sirap</hi> to his attendance.</p>
            <p>And long it was not, but that each one was in full readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and being horſed, rid to the Forreſt, where ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves, they tooke divers wayes, the ſooner to finde theyr game, but ſtill <hi>Sirap</hi> attended the <hi>Sultan,</hi> whoſe fortune was to eſpie the Boare, whetting of his angry Tuſhes in the mouth of his denne, as though hee had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene his pretended purſuit, and meant to wound his purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foes. The <hi>Sultan</hi> proud of ſuch ſucceſſe, gave ſpurres to his flying Horſe, and with careleſſe eagerneſſe unlodging the beaſt, purſued him ſo ſwiftly, that none but <hi>Sirap</hi> could come neere vnto him. The Boare ſeeing himſelfe purſued, fled by decreed deſteny towards the middeſt of the Deſart; where the Turke faſt following, was ſodainly ſeazed on by a great, fell and hideous Dragon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſo embraced within the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring armes of death, (knowing no feare to make a pawſe) ſet ſpurres to his Horſe, and ſo furiouſly runne at him with his Boare-ſpeare, that he happily wounded him under the left wing. The fierce Dragon feeling the ſmart of his hurt, left his vnkind hold, and ſmote with his wings ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Sirap,</hi> that he brake his Speare all to pieces. Then drew <hi>Sirap</hi> his Semiter, which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had that morning given him, and freſhly aſſaulted that dreadfull Beaſt with ſuch adviſed heedfulneſſe, that hardly could that enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Monſter faſten on him; ſo quicke in agility, ſo ready in dexterity, and ſo watchfull hee was at all times. But in the end he ſmote <hi>Sirap</hi> ſo forceably with his Serpentine tayle, that maugre all his might and ſtrength, he was conſtrained to fall on the ground: when the wrathfull Dragon advancing his threatning wings, and opening his infernall mouth, made offer as ſhe would devoure him at once. But <hi>Sirap</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger, carried ſo vigilant an eye, and ſo ready a hand, that the Dragon no ſooner ſtooped to feaze on him, but that, as hee lay vpright on the ground, hee ſo ſtrongly thruſt his well ſteeled Semiter into his almoſt unpenitrable
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59993:46"/>breſt, that piercing his heart, hee ſodainly prevented death by death. Now the frighted <hi>Sultan,</hi> who onely was but pinched a little with his clawes; was no ſooner free from that murthering Beaſt, but that creeping amazedly into a thicke buſhy Grove, he fearefully hid himſelfe there, ſcarce daring to lend his eyes, to behold that vncouth and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Combat. But when he ſaw <hi>Sirap</hi> on his feete, ſtriking off that gaſtly and monſtrous head; and elivating it on the point of his Semiter, and turning himſelfe, called for his Lord. Then, then, came he forth in the admiration of his thoughts; and kneeling downe, firſt gaue thankes to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> and then to him, for his ſo redeemed and preſerued life. But <hi>Sirap</hi> yeelding the heauens onely thankes, bad him aſcribe the onely glory thereof to God, and not to him a ſinfull man, or to any other ſurmized power; ſince none but God had armed his humble heart with vndaunted courage; and none but God could haue giuen his weake hand ſuch a happie Conqueſt. As thus they ſacrificed their thankes. One of the <hi>Baſhawes,</hi> that had loſt himſelfe in the purſuit, came ſtraying in by chance, unto whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the accident: with ſuch admiring wonder of <hi>Siraps</hi> worthy valour, that both the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and his <hi>Baſha,</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him as another <hi>Mahomet.</hi> In this height of <hi>Solimons</hi> joy for his ſecured life; hee commanded the <hi>Basſha</hi> himſelfe to carry the Dragons head before <hi>Sirap</hi> into the Citie, and that his man ſhould poaſt before to publiſh that thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned deed, that the Citizens might tryumph in their Lords eſcape, and honour <hi>Sirap</hi> for his purchaſed life. And no ſooner it was revealed, but that the Citizens firſt amazed with wonder, and after raviſhed with joy, wholly went to meet their earthly God; whom once reveren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, they guarded to the City gate; where the <hi>Caliph</hi> (the Primate of their ſuperſtition) to celebrate the happineſſe of <hi>Solimons</hi> preſervation, accompanied with all the order of their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Prieſts, received him, and brought him after their Hereticall, or rather Heatheniſh manner to his Pallace. The next day hee cauſed the Dragons head to be ſet on his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59993:47"/>Pallace gate, that all men beholding it, might know their Lords danger, and <hi>Siraps</hi> valour. Then he a ſtembled all his <hi>Basſhaes,</hi> and in their preſence would have created him one of his <hi>Viſiers;</hi> which with all thankfull humility hee reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently refuſed, as not capable yet of that dignity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly requeſted his Greatneſſe, that hee would for a time pardon his deniall, untill the infancy of his weake merit, were growne ſtronger in better deſerts, which well pleaſed <hi>Solimon;</hi> becauſe <hi>Solimon</hi> would not diſpleaſe <hi>Sirap.</hi> Then began he to feaſt, and to make tryumphes in his Court. Where <hi>Sirap</hi> honoured Knighthood in thoſe Juſts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe Juſts in honour of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> Such was his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carriage, ſuch his unreſiſtable courage; ſo well could hee manage his furious Steed, and ſo redoubted was hee in all his encounters, that all men rather deemed him the God of Armes, then a man in Armes. For there was neither <hi>Turke,</hi> nor <hi>Sarazen,</hi> that could withſtand his puiſſant force: nor was there any diſmounted, that held himſelfe diſhonoured. So highly did they eſtimate his unequalled valour, that they held his power rather divine then humane. As for the vulgar ſort they flock'd about to ſee him, with ſuch applauding ſhoutes, as though <hi>Mars</hi> had left his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spheare, and diſcended amongſt them, to ſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on earth.</p>
            <p>Theſe Heroicall deeds of famous Chivalry, begot admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all, but brought forth ſuch unreſiſtable affection in the faultfull <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> that what before ſhee held deadly, now ſhe deemed it not to bee veniall: Laſcivious love diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the bonds of all reſpects, and her mind being ſet on deſire nothing could limit her adventures. For though luſt cary ruine behind her, yet muſt the Queene of love enjoy the God of Warre: yea, though <hi>Vulcan</hi> frame and lay his ſubtill nets for their diſcovery. How to make <hi>Argoes</hi> ſleepe, was all her unquiet care; the eyes of the Eunuches muſt bee made: blind, eyther with Gold, or guile; which ſhee put in practice by calling theſe watching Attendants, or rather jealous Jaylors unto her; unto whom ſhee told, that the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59993:47"/>day following, <hi>Hirena</hi> another of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Wives, had ſecretly appoynted a <hi>Grecian Hero</hi> to come to ſolace with her; for as that day, the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf, his <hi>Viſters, Basſhaes,</hi> and Martiall Commanders, would ſit in the <hi>Divano,</hi> there to conſult and conclude, for the invading of <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> And if they would ſtand as faithfull Sentinels in ſuch a place as ſhe would covertly appoynt them to, and carefully make their prying eyes full witneſſes of her ſportfull abuſes, that then ſhe would guild their labours over with Gold, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their eſtates, and make them more pleaſing in the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> eyes, for that regardfull ſervice, The Eunuches, whoſe offices ſtood upon ſuch employments, embraced the offer, and promiſed theyr beſt endeavoure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultanaſſe</hi> proudly glad, that ſhe ſhould by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull meanes, be freed from theſe preventing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Spirits, made now no queſtion of opportunity; and therefore no doubt of the fruition of her deſire; To haſten which ſhe called unto her <hi>Mentiga,</hi> one of her attendants, whom ſhe before had faſhioned to her purpoſe, and gave her in ſecret charge, that ſhe ſhould that evening following, diſguiſe her ſelfe in Mans apparell, and goe to the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> and warily deliver him that Letter, and crave his anſwer.

               <hi>Sirap</hi> having read this with amazement, ſtood abaſhed, not that overpowerfull Love had given her ſuch bold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; but that licentious Luſt had armed her with ſuch Impudency. Hee now found that the dry Earth, the Grave, and a wicked Woman, were three unſatiable things: But her alluring ſollies could not win him nor her attractive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers weine him from the conſtant reſolve of his vertuous diſpoſe; For though <hi>Fortunes</hi> gates were ſet wide open for him to enter, yet hee well knew, that aſmuch would hurt the ill that hee ſhould find as the good that he ſhould looſe: Though Lawrell (he ſaid) hee of high eſteeme yet who ſo taſteth it ſhall find it bitter. Vices may vaniſh but their effects can not periſh: and therefore he choſe rather with the Bee, to extract Honey from every weed, then with the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59993:48"/>Spider to gather poyſon of the fayreſt ſlower. <hi>Viennas</hi> love was a rich rocke of defence againſt all Siren ſongs, nor would the binding benefits he had received of the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſuffer him to blaſt his benefactors Vine, nor make him mud the fountaine that gave him drinke: A perpetuall repenting ſorrow, he could not buy, for ſo golden and glorious ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a ſolace: For what profiteth it to touch, nay have the Crowne? and after to be ſmitten downe with the Scepter. Dignities aggravate the offence againſt him, that is bound not to offend; and ſuch pleaſures ever contaminate thoſe that imbrace them. Falſe diſloyaltie could not corrupt him nor could poverty infect him. As theſe conſiderations made him reſolute in the refuſall ſo doubtfull, feare made him carefull, leaſt his denyall ſhould beget diſdaine, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine bring forth direfull revenge; for vnjuſt Women, doe never appeaſe their wrathfull ires againſt juſt Men. To ſayle betwixt theſe threatning Gulphes, was dangerous, yet like a wiſe Pilot, he turned himſelfe to the ſtearne of his beſt, providencie; and taking Pen and Inke, hee no leſſe ſubtilly then ſuddainly, writ her ſuch an anſwere, as (being left of purpoſe unpointed) might ſenſibly be read, either to ſute her deſire, or to excuſe his denyall. This Letter he ſealed, and delivered it to the <hi>Protean</hi> Meſſenger, with excuſe of the neceſſity of his Religious obſervation, to celebrate his Nativitie the next day, and that he would couetouſly attend, and joyfully embrace the benefit of the next Tyde.

Now moſt meritorious Lady (ſayd <hi>Mentiga</hi>) and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyeſt of Princes, what miſlike can you gather from ſo full a conſent of love? Or what could you expect more from him, then to be wholly yours? with adventure of life, he offers love, and not regarding danger he devotes himſelf to your pleaſure. O happy Lady, Soveraign Queen of Fortune, and ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of contentment; that out of your own fancy can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over others affections, and at your own pleaſure enjoy your deſires with wiſhed delights. <hi>Eugenia</hi> amazed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with wonder, knew not what to ſay, or thinke of her ſelfe: Sure ſhee was that ſhe read it directly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and as aſſuredly ſhe found it now to bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>In this ſilent confuſed ſtudy ſhe puniſhed all her thoughts with variety of hinking, and ſtood like a fair liveleſſe picture, made to life; but wanting life, vntil fatall <hi>Mentiga</hi> awaked her wandring ſpirits, and thus merrily cheered her.</p>
            <p>Nay, moſt mighty Empreſs (ſhe ſayd) confeſs your error, and your pardon ſhall be granted: heer is nothing metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed; only you may ſee, that there is nothing well done, that is ill conſtrued. Your fear to looſe what you wiſhed to have; made you think as you doubted; beleeve what you feared; and read as you deemed. But that cloud being diſpierced, look now with comfort upon the glory of the Sun, and with joy receive the benefit of his ſweet influence, and therewithall ſhe read, and re-read it, with ſuch plain and direct pointing of it, that the <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> (being eaſily made apt to embrace what ſhe deſired) acknowledged her over ſight, and never after ſought to read it in any other manner, or to any other ſenſe.</p>
            <p>To ratifie which, <hi>Mentiga</hi> told her, that he ſorrowfully craved pardon for his next days attendance. For that it being his birth day, he was tyed both by his Countries cuſtom, and by his oblieged obſervance, religiouſly to celebrate it, in a ſacred ſort according to their wonted and hallowed manner. This was ſomewhat cordiall unto her wounded heart, though not ſo comfortable as ſhe deſired. And yet it did (becauſe it muſt)

In the mean time he left the pleaſing and entiſing ſports of the court (for pleaſures are no paſtimes for male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and diſconſolated men) and purpoſely walked all alone into the fields (the freer to enjoy his own thoughts) where ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly making a ſtand in his melancholy pauſe, he writ in the ſand with the point of his ſword as follows.</p>

Then, then, drowning the late flowing ſtreame of his gotten glory, in the full Sea of preſent hard haps; he began thus to eaſe his oppreſſing griefe, by pleading, and publiſhing to the winds his caſe, and cauſe of grievous care.</p>
            <p>O falſe Fortune (ſaid he) conſtant only in inconſtancy, how haſt thou made me a mirror of thy many mutabilities.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Lynx,</hi> this Blood-hound to miſchief, hunted after opportunity, to reſolve this doubt, and by fortune encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> in the Market-place, whither the <hi>Dolphin</hi> his Lord had ſent him to buy ſome neceſſaries; Vnto whom in Latine (as the moſt generall Tongue, beſt known to all) the politique Merchant gave many kind ſalutes, offering him ſecretly for the love he bare to Chriſt, and Chriſtians, all the beſt Offices he might perform, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall, (to gaine the more credit) not to make himſelfe known in ſo dangerous and impious a place. <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> (being better Learned then travelled) finding himſelf ſo kindly intreated by a ſtranger, returned thanks, and joyfully embrac'd his courteſie.

            <p>The Marchant, having waded thus farre into the depth of his awaked intention, thought good to ſound the Foord at full by undermining their projects: And therefore in the curteſie of their Bacchonizing cups, he gave him ſome few pieces of Gold, wiſhing him to make his wants known, with the diſtreſſe of his Companion, that he might privately relieve them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly give them comfort and directions for their more ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>This falſe fire (the ſeeming ſhew of good regard) burnt up all <hi>Mal Fiances</hi> fear of diſtruſt; the ſtrength of hot wines, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all due conſideration, and the joy he took in finding ſo good a Chriſtian amongſt unbeleeving <hi>Infidels,</hi> made him unadviſedly tell the Merchant who he was, whom he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oed, and where his Lord the Prince was. This Machivilian Marchant, being now fully enformed of what he deſired, the better to mature his ill deſign, ſpake to the Maſter of the Houſe in the <hi>Slavonian</hi> Tongue, (a Language much uſed amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi>) that he ſhould ſtay that Stranger, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

            <p>THE Saviour of the faithfull, the comfortable Sonne of the moſt Righteous, all-Seeing, and Everliving GOD, make your Excellency moſt happy in all your intendments, and guard your perſon from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and malice of cruell Miſcreants. To teſtifie my Faith by my Workes, and to preſerve the living Plants of Chriſts Vineyard, from the bloody handes of the deſtroyer.

            <p>The perfideous Marchants fear (for ſtill he ſeemed fearfully to fear) haled him away to his chamber, where he cloſely kept him with reſpect, untill the next day; againſt which time he had provided two ſwift Dromidaries well furniſhed, to carry them to <hi>Babilm,</hi> there to make preſent of ſo great and ſtrange a Prince unto the <hi>Soldan</hi> his King, promiſing himſelf, either a great ſhare in his ranſome, or no ſmall reward for his ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Prize.</p>
            <p>The long travail of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> made him give way to all ſuſpitious thoughts: His journies were greater then ſtood with eaſe or liking; Yet what he could not avoid he learned to bear; neceſſity enforced him a conſtant patience. But being come to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was preſented to the <hi>Soldan</hi> and like a Captive (in tryumph) he was led through the City to priſon. The dejected <hi>Dolphin</hi> (whoſe French Fortunes were but erſt the Miniſters of his wil) was now ſo controled, and deprived of all dignity, that hopeleſſe of his life, he had no other comfort, then to be voyd of all comfort: Sometimes he would invey againſt the deteſtable treachery of his deceitfull Servant, and condemn his own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity in beleeving an Unbeleever. Then would he curſe his over-glorious deſire of Popularity, the ground of his grief in ſeeking applauſe with danger, and hazarding his perſon to give liking to others, But after when humble miſery had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his diſcontented thoughts, hee then caſt off his Adders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinne; and ſoft Pitty did enter in at an Iron gate: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then his own cruell Tyranny, in anothers long digeſted miſery, he let fall ſome relenting teares, and paſſionately he thus bewayled his Daughters endurance, in his owne thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

            <p>O cruell Father, unhappy <hi>Dolphin:</hi> O forlorn <hi>Vienna,</hi> but moſt diſtreſſed daughter. The Heathens make my death their Heaven, and my neereſt friends account my life their hell. The earth now diſdains to bear me, and yet the heavens deny to receive me. Men ſcorne me in my fall, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth me in my ſin: So ſhall I dye diſdayned of moſt, bewayled of none, and unregarded of all. Thus did miſery, and ſorrow (the kind ſiſters of mercy, and true wakers of compaſſion) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract tears and ſighs from ſtony cruelty; as ſtrokes do force fire out of hardeſt Flints.</p>
            <p>But leaving him to his more deſerved dolours; Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the great <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Turky,</hi> who hearing of the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s apprehenſion, and that he was a priſoner at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> wrote inſtantly to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> that in no wiſe he ſhould releaſe him: In the Interim, he joying wondred, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring enjoyned, that Bonefires, Feaſts, and Tryumphs, ſhould be made throughout the City. In ſuch high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and fearfull regard, did they hold him for his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious diſcipline, practiſe pollicies, turbulent ſpirit, Martiall provocation, approved directions, and rare ſtratagems, that now taken, they held (in this preſage) the Conqueſt, certain. But <hi>Sirap</hi> underſtanding the cauſe of theſe rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, was aſtoniſhed at the newes. Report could not make him beleeve what reaſon ſhewed was falſe. His greatneſſe he thought denyed all private exployts, and his yeares gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſuch tedious travaile. The places were too farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; and there was no combination of Chriſtian Princes, to undertake a generall Warre. Traffique ſtood not with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59993:55"/>his dignity, and pleaſure could not draw his age to perill. His command at home, would not ſuffer him to go from home: Nor durſt he truſt the faith of a Subject, nor the ſtrength of his Foes: He had no Son, and therefore moſt ſubject to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour invaſions. He was wiſe, and more feared then beloved; And therefore he had cauſe to fear many, whom many did fear. Theſe, and other reaſons, perſwaded him to the falſity thereof.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Sultan</hi> diſcourſing of the truth, and the manner thereof wounded him with wonder, and made belief ſubſcribe to his relation. Now grief arreſted his loyall heart, and made his dutifull regard, a priſoner to his penſive thoughts. His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Country, was now forſaken, and made a pray for the avaricious Forraigner. His diſtreſſed Lady deſtitute of his help, when ſhe had moſt need of his ayd.</p>
            <p>This was his greateſt grief, and this commanded his return: But judgment told him, that her right failed, while the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> lived, that the Nature of Juſtice was to render to every one his own, and that that he was bound for <hi>Vienna</hi>'s ſake, and as a Subject, to induſtriate himſelf for his delivery: And though his exile awaked Revenge, yet Charity, he knew, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forgetfulneſs of evill deeds. His Countries hazard, he dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leſſe then his Lords loſſe. The miſcarrying of the one, might be holpen by the recovery of the other: but the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Prince would beget both forraign and inteſtine broyls.</p>
            <p>In this perſwaſion, he ſecretly vowed his beſt endeavours for his infranchiſement; and ſecretly ſmothered his ſorrow, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taking notice of the accident, nor making enquiry after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occurrants. In the expiration of few days, being in the Court, he found the <hi>Sultan</hi> alone, in the mildneſs of his unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall mood, both pleaſing and pleaſant: In that happy hour he took opportunity by the fore-part, and (impriſoning his worthy reſolution within the Cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> unwilling to leave him; in that he both loved him affectionatly, and intended to make a profitable uſe of his great, and unequalled valour, perſwaded him to ſtay ſtill with him, and he ſhould command in <hi>Turkie,</hi> dwell in his grace, and live in height of honour. But <hi>Sirap</hi> pleading ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to go, promiſed ſpeedy return; and that in lieu of his favours, he would beſtow all his remaining dayes in his ſervice. This pleaſed the Turk ſo well, that he yeelded to his requeſt, and to his encouragement for his back repair: He gave him Princely Robes (as Ornaments of Honour) to countenance him; rich Jewels to ſhew his Dignity; and great Treaſure to defray his anſwerable diſpence.</p>
            <p>He ſurniſhed him with Attendants, eſpecially with one of knowledge in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tongue, to be his Interpreter.</p>
            <p>He alſo writ unto the <hi>Soldan,</hi> to receive him, as one moſt compleat in all worth, worthy all honour, honoured by <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the great, his eſpeciall Favourite, and the God of Wars chiefeſt Champion; and therefore he entreated him to receive him with all Royall regard, and to give him what content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he might; and the rather, in that he purpoſely came to ſee his magnificency, and the ſtate, both of his Court, and City. This no little availed <hi>Sirat,</hi> in his intendments, and theſe Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favours, and furthering means made him no leſſe joyfull for his proud hopes; then moſt humbly thankfull for the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> ſo gracious a reſpect.</p>
            <p>And ſo taking a ſubmiſſive leave for that time; He would needs for his pleaſure go to <hi>Pera,</hi> a City diſtant but a mile from <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And as he croſſed <hi>Thracius Basforus,</hi> (a water that only divideth the two Cities:) he fortunately e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied amongſt the Gally-ſlaves that rowed him, a French-man no otherwiſe known to him, then the Cloath to the Liſt:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59993:56"/>For though ſeven yeares ſlaviſh Captivity had made him a <hi>Grecian</hi> in his tongue; and dyed his Sunne-burnt skinne more blacker, then his Native hue; yet did his making, and manner of his ſpeech, proclaim him a French man. Of him in Greek, he demanded what was his name, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who anſwered <hi>France</hi> is my Country; <hi>Bonfoy</hi> my name, which pleaſed him well. Then (without diſcovering himſelfe, or taking further knowledge of him) he asked, Whether he would for his Liberty, faithfully and truely ſerve, and follow him, and his fortunes: and he would after ſometime, ſend him into his own Country, whereſoever it was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonfoy</hi> to gain that happy freedom, and to be free from that miſerable and baſe ſlavery; ſwore by the Son of God, who was made man, that men might be made the ſonnes of God; that he would truly, and faithfully (during his pleaſure) tye himſelf, and all his endeavours, to his command. Whereupon <hi>Sirap</hi> begg'd him of the Captain, that durſt not deny him any thing, and ever after moſt kindly uſed him, and loved him, becauſe hee would be, not only ſerved but beloved of him: That forth of that love hee might the better truſt him, and be the better inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in him. For where love hath ſupremacy, there all affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions attend on it, and all other paſſions are overſwayed by it.</p>
            <p>But now the ſenſuall <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> hearing of <hi>Siraps</hi> haſty proviſion for his ſuddain departure to <hi>Babylon,</hi> grew more then impatient in her diſcontented feares; and beyond all conſideration of her ſtate, deplored the hardneſſe of her hap. Her luſtfull hopes were now wounded in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of he rlaſcivious deſires, and unbounded love ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt her unchaſt thoughts, that finding her infected affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fruſtrated of conceived joyes, ſhe fainted under the burthen of her unexpected vows. In this ſad alteration ſhe threw her ſelfe on the humble floore, where her dumbe ſorrowes uttered nought but bemoaning teares, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning ſighes: Which <hi>Mentiga</hi> ruefully beholding, and well weying that this unwelcome event would deprive her
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59993:56"/>of enriching favours, and of promiſed preferments, ſhe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned her wits together, and ſet them all on the rack of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, to find out means of ſome redreſs.</p>
            <p>At laſt, after a ſad and ſerious pauſe, ſhe ſaid; Take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort moſt mighty Empreſs, and my moſt gracious Soveraign, let this ſuddain lightning dye in his abortiye birth, and liſten to your moſt ſubmiſſive Handmaid, who deſires no longer life, then ſhe may do your Highneſs acceptable ſervice. Your Knight is no doubt, enfore'd (by the <hi>Sultans</hi> employment) to this unliked journey, and your remembrance will not only be a plea for his diſparch; but his controling affection will alſo give ſpeed to his return.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I will undertake to bring him this night to your bed, where you may make your deſired delights, do homage to your wills, pay tribute to your ſufferance, and bind him over to accompliſh your further pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Then raiſe your better thoughts, this baſe floor (but your foot-ſtool) is no bed for Majeſty: Nor ſtands it with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendant Queen of ASIA, to proſtrate her ſelf ſo low, as to lie in the duſt of the earth. <hi>Eugenia</hi> thus rowzed, roſe (with an erected heart) from her ſeat of ſorrow, and carefully looking on her, ſaid; Ah, <hi>Montiga, Mentiga,</hi> can it be that Phyſick hath any Cordiall Receipt for ſo deſperate a Diſeaſe? Is there any mollifying ſalve can cure my tormenting ſore? or canſt thou give a healing plaiſter, to my wounded mind. Speak thou hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, or moſt happy woman: When, where, or how, canſt thou effect ſo great, and ſweet a work; and pleaſe thy Lady without perceivance? The glorious Sun (thou know'ſt) is ever remarkable, when mean Stars are ſeldom gazed on. Pale <hi>Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie</hi> is a ſubtile ſpie; and invincible <hi>Envie</hi> hath murthering eyes. <hi>Danger</hi> waits on dignities, and <hi>Beauty</hi> is ever guarded with obſervance. The light (I fear) is a blab, and darkneſſe but a Traytor: Theſe walls have eares, then be ſilent <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiga,</hi> leaſt the Ayr whilper, and betray thy intention, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
            <p>Thus had <hi>Eugenia</hi> (when it came to it) many Eyes, to ſee into many Evils, but they were all blind to prevent any.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59993:57"/>Misfortune ſo blindeth thoſe ſhe will overthrow, that nothing can cleer their underſtandings, nor limit their adventures; which made <hi>Mentiga</hi> anſwer that ſhe had a Charm to cloſe up <hi>Argoes</hi> eyes, and that deceit ſhould lull danger a ſleep, when Beauty ſhould feaſt with love. And this ſhe ſayd it is, and muſt be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan,</hi> you know (either to refreſh himſelf with eaſe or to make his pleaſures more compleat by change) doth the two laſt nights of every week, abſtain both from your bed and Chamber; And this enſuing night being the firſt of the two, when your <hi>Eunuches</hi> be at ſupper, wee will in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſecretly change our attyres, and ſo give life to our device, you muſt as <hi>Mentiga</hi> bring me as Empereſſe to your bed, where leaving me, you ſhall depart into my Chamber next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, where faſtening the door you muſt attend the hour of midnight, and then putting on my Night-gown, you muſt as ſilently as may be go down the ſtaires into the Garden, and thereopening the poſtern gate, (the key whereof ſhall be preprovided for you) you ſhall receive your diſguiſed Knight and bringing him up the ſtaires to my Chamber, you both may ſafely entertain your ſtoln delights; and give both your deſires all fulneſs of content.</p>
            <p>But how (ſaid <hi>Eugenia</hi>) ſhall he return undiſcovered. Early in the morning replied <hi>Mentiga,</hi> before the day ſhall deſcry your dalliances, will I riſe and come unattyred unto you to my chamber, when you ſhal leave my bleſt and beautified bed, and returne to your owne chamber in ſuch manner as I came. And then will I cloathe your Knight in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious habite of the <hi>Hozes,</hi> the ſame I uſed, when I went to him. And ſo hee may depart, when the Sunne (the eye of the world) ſhall not diſcover him. For clouded Rocks deceive Marriners; A juſtifiable cloake ever hides a treacherous fraude, and they ever may do the moſt wrong of whom leaſt is looked for. And becauſe we will not procraſtinate our deſignes, leſt our projects bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. I will preſently put on my <hi>Protean</hi> ſhape, and like a holy Father, go to <hi>Sirap,</hi> unto whom I will unfold
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59993:57"/>all that we have determined, and both enjoyn and entreat him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> your name, and for your love, that he will not fayl his hour, at that place, but come to take Loves farewell, and leave a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led poſſeſſion of his purchaſed favours.</p>
            <p>This enticing plot, promiſed more to <hi>Eugonia</hi> then a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. Her lawleſſe love ſaw no exception, nor could her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonizing thoughts dream of any interception: Her tranſported deſires were ſo drowned in her over-amorous paſſion, that ſhe entertained the leaſt conceit, that might but help her fooliſh fancy. Her flattering hopes held good correſpondency with all likelihoods; and in the confidence of her ſuppoſed aſſurance ſhe bad her go, and after called her back again. Her preſaging heart did fayl her, and ſhe began to fear ſhe knew not what. A ſudden trembling poſſeſſed her in every part, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe but careleſly dreaded, now ſhe did more then fearing doubt. In this diſtraction, and fear of miſadventure ſhe ſayd; It is better to be in love moſt miſerable, then through love to be guilty of our owne manifeſt confuſion. Why ſhould we then <hi>Mentiga</hi> for our lovingfolies weave the web of our own woes? Violent ſtreams being once run out the mud will appear in the bottom. The indignation of a Prince is death; and the love of a ſtranger as inconſtant, as a Travellers mind is wandring. He is but mean, and puddles are not for Princes to drink at: Let him be as he is, that I may be as I am. O <hi>Eugenia!</hi> hadſt thou been as provident to ſhun the cauſe of thy fall; as thou was fooliſhly wiſe to apprehend thy fall:
<q>
                  <l>Thou might have longer liv'd in thy renown,</l>
                  <l>But now thy ſins are ripe; Fate throws thee down.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For ſhe being drawn by a wilfull folly, unto that whereunto ſhe was deſtinate, no ſooner had uttered what ſhe miſliked, but ſtraight ſhe miſliked what ſhe had uttered. Shall idle doubt (ſaid ſhe) the hearſe of our deſires, deprive me of my wiſhed delights? Is baſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59993:58"/>fear (the badge and terror of Peaſants) a befitting Counſellour for a commauding Empereſſe? or is love tyed to equality, honour, or majeſty, that knowes no difference of perſons? Muſt greateſt Queens want their wills, and the droſie of Damoſels enjoy their pleaſures? Where then is our dignityes, our prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and our priviledges? To command others, and be ſlaves to our ſelves, is worſe then ſubjection. I will be my ſelf, my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſhall bow to my will, and my fancy ſhall command my pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Neceſſity hath no law, and where there is no law, there is no breach. Here <hi>Mentiga</hi> take this purſe, and happily get thee gone, &amp; fortunately return. This concluding command gave her ſpeed, and being come before him, ſhe thus in his privat chamber all alone ſalutes him,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia,</hi> the great Emperiall <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> Soveraign Queene of Queens, and only Mirror of Beauty and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by me her truſty Hand-maid greetes thee well, and wiſheth thee (O thou happieſt of men, and bleſt Sonne of Fortune) all the joyes that thy heart can wiſh, or her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can afford. She grieves that thou art bound for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> and ſhe entreats thee, that diſguiſed this night, at the hour of twelve, when darkneſſe hath put on her blackeſt robe, thou wilt come to the Poſtern-gate of the Garden Wall, where ſhe will in perſon receive thee, and ſafely bring thee, where thou mayeſt Bathe thy ſelf, in Beauties moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Fountaine, and feaſt thy beſt Fortunes, with all the pleaſures that true Love, or proud State can yeeld. Nor mayeſt thou doubt of hazard herein, ſince thy ſecurity is thus carefully and certainly aſſured. And therewithall ſhe related to him the whole plot of their device; which ſhe ſaid was onely intended, that by your incorporated ſarewels, you both might ſeal ſuch an infringeable deed of your cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Loves, that nought but death ſhould breake the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> being thus ſurprized, when leaſt he looked for ſuch an aſſault wiſhed himſelf in <hi>Babilon.</hi> His vertuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, did contemne ſuch ſhamefull treachery: Nor would
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59993:58"/>he violate his plighted faith to <hi>Vienna,</hi> for all the proud for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and Favours of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affrick:</hi> Yet fearing, leaſt his refuſall ſhould croſſe his departure, he ſmoothly ſet a ſcarletdy, on his rough and courſe conceit, and like <hi>Iove</hi> himſelf when he entred <hi>Danaes</hi> Tower, he ſeemed both pleaſant and pleaſing to <hi>Mentiga;</hi> which made her more apt to beleeve what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant.</p>
            <p>Return (ſayd he) unto the brighteſt Star, and greateſt Glory of <hi>Turkie,</hi> and preſent in all humble humbleneſſe, my true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto her, and ſay; That in the entercourſe of Affection, my Love ſurmounts hers, and that neither danger nor death ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or hinder, the wiſhed fruition of my fancy, ſo fortified by a Princes favour: To take my farewell is my thirſting deſire and to ſeal the deed of my purchaſed favour, is the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian knot that I moſt wiſh to unlooſe; Be true to thy Queen, wiſe to thy ſelf, give thy thoughts no tongue, nor my name no record.</p>
            <p>Thus did he in another meaning ſatisfie blinded <hi>Mentiga;</hi> who proud of her ſurmized ſucceſſe, that raviſhed with joy, that taking a compendious farewell, ſhe poſted (in the conceit of her happy endeavours) to feaſt <hi>Eugenia</hi> with her glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>And no ſooner was ſhe gone, but that <hi>Sirap</hi> falling on his knees, beſought God to guard his innocency, from all <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> perils, and to free his chaſte thoughts from thoſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Syrens,</hi> thoſe ruinating Follies, and thoſe laſcivious and nefarious Aſſaults; and that he would ſo direct him in his wiſedome, and ſo defend him by his power, that he might ſafely (without interruption) go to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and for the good of his Sanctuary, remove that Piller of his Church out of the houſe of <hi>Dagon,</hi> and bring him home to be a Glory to his temple. This ſaerifice was his ſafeguard; His vertuous deter mination, and conſtant reſolution, merited well; but his firme affiance in his God, and dependancy on Divine perfection, ſhielded him, no doubt, from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of that adherent miſchiefe that fell fatally upon the <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Mentiga:</hi> Yet in ſeeking to avoyd <hi>Scylla,</hi> he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59993:59"/>feared to fall into <hi>Charibdis:</hi> His non-appearance, would make his fraud apparant; and his deluſion, might draw on his ſecret deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mentiga</hi> comming to her Soveraign Lady (who long had expected her before ſhe came, though ſhe came long before reaſon could expect her) chearfully recounted unto her, what <hi>Sirap</hi> (in truth but not truly) had proteſtingly delivered unto her; how pleaſing her meſſage was to him; how joyfully he entertained the Name of Love; how feelingly he entred into compariſon for his affection; and how comfortably he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the remembrance of his deſired Fare-well.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and other demonſtrances of Paſſion, ſheſo full and pleaſantly related, that <hi>Eugenia</hi> drowning all thoughts of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the conceit of her approaching happineſſe, ſhe dreamed of nought but <hi>Loves</hi> Embracements, <hi>Venus</hi> Delights, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonizing Sports; building a Pallace of Pleaſure in her mind, wherein ſhe meant to feaſt all her Amorous deſires, and crown her thoughts with ſweet content.</p>
            <p>To this end, ſhe gave <hi>Mentiga</hi> in charge, that nothing ſhould be wanting, that ſhould be requifite to further their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; Whilſt interrupted <hi>Sirap</hi> (being thus chequ'd by a Queen) lay ſtudying how he might drive it to a Stall, and not receive the Mate but give ſpeed to his departure.</p>
            <p>Reſolved he was, not to touch the forbidden Fruit, nor to drink on <hi>Circes</hi> Cup; he would not with the Spider ſuck poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of a fair Flower, nor ſpot his true-love with the dregs of Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Proud bewitching pleaſure could not intice him to Folly, nor rich alluring Treaſures corrupt his conſtant integrity: He ſcorned to ſell his Loyalty for Lucre, or Love for Silver: True wiſdom made his vertuous mind to bend, rather to that which was good in it ſelf, then to that, which by evill minds might be judged good.</p>
            <p>In brief, his concluſion was, to excuſe his not comming, by expreſſe command from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that as that night, he ſhould conſult with his <hi>Viſiers,</hi> concerning his Negotiation in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59993:59"/>
But this falſe colour need no allowance, Diſpleaſed Juſtice took away all exception, and ſealed him pardon before any accuſation: For the diſmall night being come, Vengeance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her fatall hour; which approaching, ſhe accordingly changed her attire with <hi>Mentiga,</hi> and brought her as her Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to her Royall Bed, and after went to <hi>Mentiga's</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſhe waking, wayted for the appointed hour; which come, ſhe caſting on <hi>Mentigaes</hi> Night-gown, with a bold heart (beyond the reſolve of her weak Sex) ſhe paced down the ſtairs that led into the Garden; Into which, ſhe no ſooner entred, but that ſhe ſaw the angry Heavens (then clad all in black) throwing down with violence, a fiery threatning Star over-croſſe the Garden, forbidding her farther paſſage, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſable Skies lent not then an other Light.</p>
            <p>This prodigious Sign, and fearfull premonition, might well have appaled and back'd a more-redoubted heart, but that the voluptuouſneſſe of her thoughts, extinguiſhed the light of her mind. Love gave her boldneſſe, and unlimited Luſt directed her (according to her ſiniſter and deſtinated Fate) unto the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern gate, which ſhe with nimble facility opened, and there made her fearleſs ſtand.</p>
            <p>O imperious and impious Love, thou deluding Traytor, how rightly did the Poets and Painters, paint thee blind, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Since thou haſt no eyes to ſee into how many dangers thou leadeſt thy ſervants; and like thy ſelf, makeſt them both blind and naked, diſrobeing them of all their vertuous abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that their naked ſhame may appear in their found pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.</p>
            <p>Who ſeeketh thee, findeth deceit; and whoſoever followes thee, ſeeketh reproach, and obtaineth repentance. <hi>Care,</hi> is thy Court; <hi>Tyranny,</hi> thy Raign; <hi>Slaves,</hi> thy Subjects; <hi>Polly,</hi> thy attendance; <hi>Lust,</hi> thy Law; <hi>Sin,</hi> thy ſervice; and <hi>Repentance,</hi> thy wages. But this mighty <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> whoſe wretched folly, was cloathed in danger, had not long waited for her own woe, but that there came a baſe <hi>Sarazen</hi> towards her, who of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe did ſtraggle that way, to ſeize upon ſome prey; the fall of whoſe ſteps, gave the found <hi>Sultaneſſe</hi> ſuch hope of <hi>Siraps</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59993:60"/>then comming, that over raſhly running upon him; holding for certain that it was he; ſhe ſaid, Come, come my beſt beloved and go with me, where I will lodge thy love in pleaſures lap, and guerdon thy labours with fulneſſe of gold; And therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhe kiſt him, more then oft, deeming that his rough habit had been but the cloak of his craft. For the Prince and the Peaſant differeth but in the flaece, not in the fleſh. But the ſubtile <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> being capable of his own good, apprehended the errour, and in hope of gain adventured the ſucceſſe. Thus did the mounting Kite, ſeize on a homely prey, and in her blindneſſe, preſer a greaſie lamp, before a bright and mighty Star; and throwing her Mantle upon him, led him towards her laſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bed, where he fearing to be diſcovered, diſveſted himſelf of his homely habite and rough ſhirt.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And did (redid, and often did) full well,</l>
               <l>The thing my modeſt Muſe doth bluſh to tell.</l>
               <l>For with a luſty courage <hi>(ſtoutly borne)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He did (in <hi>Siraps</hi> ſtead) the <hi>Sultan</hi> horn.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And in this ſurfeit of pleaſure did they cloy themſelves till themſelves had wholly ſpent themſelves. When wearied with delights, they both were ſummoned by leaden <hi>Morpheus</hi> to banquet with bloud and death. For the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> (by divine decree) dreaming that night, that the roofe of <hi>Eugenias</hi> Chamber did renting part it ſelf in two, and was open; and that hee ſaw deſcending downe from a black Cloud; a grim ſwarty man, cloathed in a ſhort ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured garment, all to be rent, holding a broad ruſty ſword, dyed with Vermillion red in his beſmeared hand. Who falling on the tapeſtred floore, ſtood not long; but that <hi>Eugenia</hi> came ſmiling all in white, beſprinkled thick with blood, and put on him a ſcarlet robe, ſet her Diadem on his ſhaggy head; kiſſed, and embraced him oft, and then taking him by the ſoyled hand, led him towards her royall bed; which the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſeeming to ſee, cryed out, and ſayd:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59993:60"/>Stay villain, ſtay; The Eagle made not her neſt for the Owle to lye in; The Batte hath no eyes to looke upon the Sunne, nor may the Keſtrell make her pearch within her beams.</p>
            <p>And therewithall, graſping for his Semitar he amazedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, and finding it but a dream, ſmiled, yet was wounded with no little wonder at the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſame. His thoughts ſtill were troubled and his heart (led thereunto by the force of Fate) gave him ſuch a preſent deſire to go offer incenſe to <hi>Venus,</hi> in <hi>Engenia</hi>'s ſhrine, that ſodainly taking his night robe, his Semitary, and his key, (which pur poſely he had made for his ſole and private paſſage at all times into her Chamber) he went to perform his wanton Sacrifice: and being entred fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by the dawn of day (for the night began to eaſt off her black Mantle) that all things as he thought were well, he joyed at the illuſion of his phantaſticall dream, and in the contentment thereof, withdrawing a little the curtain, he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly laid him, down by <hi>Mentigaes</hi> ſide: who upon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance awaked, and finding her ſelf intangled in her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, grew fearefull of the iſſue, and kept her ſelfe as cloſe as might be. The <hi>Sultans</hi> kind entreaties, found no reſiſtance, nor yet any pleaſing entertainment. The fear of her death, took away all delight of dalliance; and thoſe pleaſures which before ſhe made her Paradiſe, ſhe now deemed them a mortall puniſhment. Faine would ſhe have killed her ſelfe, for feare of death, but death gave her no means of death. In this deadly terrour ſhe lay ſo diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that every member began ſo to tremble and ſhake, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> in tenderneſſe of her health, (fearing ſickneſſe ſuddain attachment) haſtily took her in his armes, and kiſſing her many times, asked her how ſhe fared, but receiving no anſwer (for ſuddaine ſurprized Treaſon hath no tongue) he bare her towards the light, to give her better ayr, when ſeeing who ſhe was, and on whom he had ſpent his enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced pleaſures; miſsing <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and remembring his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking dream; all enraged, he caſt her to the floor, and treading on her throate, bee tooke his Semitar, and thruſt it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59993:61"/>quite through her heart, and then violently running at the door that opened into <hi>Mentigaes</hi> Chamber, he burſt it open: The noiſe whereof awaked the ſturdy ſlave, that he might ſee his own death; who ſeeing one enter with his ſword drawn, not knowing who he was, nor where himſelf was, leap'd out of his banefull bed, and ſnatching a bed-ſtaffe in his hand, fiercely ruſhed upon his vnknown Lord, got within him, and being the ſtronger, had him down, and ſo liberally belaboured him, that the bloud running down his face, well witneſſed that the ſlave alone, now leſſe reſpected and feared him; then many Nations, mightieſt Armies, and greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that onely had trembled at his ſight. Which made the <hi>Snltan</hi> in his diſmay, cry; Treaſon, treaſon; at the hearing whereof came running in two Janizaries that were of his Guard, whoſe allotment was that day amongſt many others to attend.</p>
            <p>They ſeeing this ſtrange accident, pulled the raſcall off the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and hewed him all to pieces. But the <hi>Sulianeſſe</hi> thus ſurprized with ſhame, with fear, and with amazement, was more confounded at the baſe ſight of her reproachfull deceit, then at the bloody ſummons of pale death; and becauſe ſhe would not ſee her owne ſhame, nor looke murther in the face, ſhe crept over the head into the bed, crying fearefully, No <hi>Moor,</hi> no <hi>Moor;</hi> becauſe ſhe ſaw, ſhe had not layn with the <hi>Moor.</hi> Which made <hi>Solimon</hi> ſuppoſe, that ſhe cried that he ſhould ſtay his hand and do no more; which diſtaſtfull conceit, exaſperated his anger, and added more fewell to his enflamed fire, and in the heat of his irefull indignation, he ſtep'd to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous bed, and like a tempeſtuous ſtorm he fell upon her, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her ſtab upon ſtab, ſaying oft withall; Nay, thus much more and more: And the more he ſaid ſo, the more he thruſt his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar (not yet dryed with the bloud of the Sarazen) into her body.</p>
            <p>This ſpeedy and ſuddain execution, was <hi>Siraps</hi> preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it took away all further knowledge of the cauſe. The Court was now all in combuſtion, and the City hearing that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was ſlain, inſtantly did riſe, and confuſedly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59993:61"/>did run to the Pallace, bearing all down before them in ſuch a diſtract ſort, that the Turks Guard was glad to ſhut the Gares againſt them, and to entreat the <hi>Sultan</hi> to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Caſement unto them, which ſo well appeaſed them, that they quietly returned to their houſes.</p>
            <p>Then was inquiſition made after the knowledge of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razene</hi> apparell, which, was ſo baſe, that all men wondered not only that he was there, but how he came there: His mangled body kept him unknown, and his mean habit made him no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertenant to the Court.</p>
            <p>When no notice could be had neither of the one, nor of the other, the appeaſed <hi>Sultan</hi> ſent for the Eunuches that attended his Empereſs, and cauſed two <hi>Mutes</hi> to ſtrangle them in his ſight. After, he cauſed all the dead bodies, with the two beds, and all their Apparell, to be carryed forth of the City, and to be burned all together; and further, gave in charge, that the two Chambers ſhould be converted into houſes of baſe uſe, and that no one under pain of death ſhould after ſpeak thereof.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap,</hi> who during theſe tempeſtuous ſtorms, lay at anchor in his own private Harbour, as one that knew well, that great men ever envying the glory and fortune of ſtrangers, would in theſe tumults be ready to ſtab at the boſome of merit; and that Miſchief (the curſed Captain always of the unruly Commons,) might in a diſturbed uproar indanger his ſafety; hearing now that the ſight of the <hi>Sultan</hi> had allayed the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Allarum of his rumoured death, and that the preſent mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> with her Maid and unknown Paramor, was the occaſion of ſuch diſorder riſing; He grew jealous of the Cauſe, ſuſpicious of the Firour, and timorous of his wend fare.</p>
            <p>For, though gliarded with innocency, yet was he fearfull, leſt <hi>Mentiga</hi> had caſt ſome ſcandalizing aſperſion upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled honeſty.</p>
            <p>In this fearfull doubt, he kept himſelf within himſelf, untill report had further manifeſted not only the manner of all their Deaths, but the ignorance of the Cauſe. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierced all Clouds of care, and made him a perfect Judge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59993:62"/>both of the error and the event. Then lifting up his erected heart, he ſaid: O <hi>Vienna,</hi> thy love I ſee now hath given me a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond life, and my conſtant loyalty hath kept me from the grave, <hi>Inſtice</hi> hath preſerved the guiltleſs, and righteouſneſs hath found mercy in judgement,</p>
            <p>Now praiſed be my God my ſtrong defence: For he hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me under the wings of his protection, and kept me from the death of the wicked. He hath caſt down lightning and burnt up the Daughters of <hi>Babell,</hi> that I might be ſafe in their ſuddain deſtruction. The ſtorm is paſt, and theſe cloudy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currants threaten another tempeſt. The Sea cannot be ſo calm in Summer, but that it may ſwell again with the rage of wrathfull winter; There is more wiſedom in prerenting then in redreſſing a miſchief; Security lives not in tyranny. For though the Tyger hide his clawes, yet in the end will he ſhew his Rapine. Revenge hath now ſmoothed the <hi>Sultans</hi> angry brow, and Time hath given ſome peace to his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The tide ſerves me, and my prophane aboad with the heathen is diſpleaſing to the heavens. My captived Lord calls me away and <hi>Vienna</hi> ſays, I am too ſlow; my mark is ſet, and I levell ſtreight, I will comend my aim, and therewithall caſting off all further deliberation, he went to the Court to take his leave of <hi>Solimon,</hi> who ſeeing him ſtand upon his departure, after ſome private conference and proteſtations, that he would crown his return with higheſt honours advancement, he vouchſafed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to embrace him, and ſo bad him farewell.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Sirap</hi> having before cauſed all things to be in readineſſe, the winds ſummoning him to Sea, he took ſhipping, and ſayling by the Iſlands, ſcituate in part of the Mediteranean Sea, he landed at <hi>Sidon</hi> a Port Town in <hi>Syria</hi> and there taking Horſe, he poſted through the Country, and part of the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and ſo came to <hi>Babylon.</hi> Where we will leave him to look into <hi>France,</hi> and ſee how <hi>Vienna</hi> brookes her continued thraldome, which was not ſo grievous unto her, as the tormenting ſuppoſe of Sir <hi>Paris</hi> loſſe. Great was her ſorrow in fear of him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59993:62"/>her bernoanings for not hearing from him. Inſomuch, that <hi>La-nova</hi> ſeeing the increaſe of her growing cares, thus ſadly ſpake unto her.</p>
            <p>Madam, theſe ruthleſſe Walls neither melt with your tears, nor yet ſhake, nor ſhrink with your ſighes. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort dwels not in reſtraint, nor lives remedy in Lamentations. Though your Father be abſent, yet hath he left a jealous Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: You may ever weep and bewayl your eſtate, and ly ſtill in the bed of ſorrow: If you never ſeek after redreſſe, you ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find your ſelf a Priſoner: You know the ſcorer way I made to relieve you: If ſo you pleaſe, I will convey you through the ſame, to ſome private place, where Metamorphoſed we will either hunt in queſt after Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> or you ſhall reſt unknown in ſome Forraign Nation, till either my travell ſhall gain knowledge of his aboad, or that the death of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſhall leave (you for your right) to the tryell of your friends,</p>

            <p>This kind offer did move her much, but could not remove her at all; Liberty ſhe ſaid was ſweet to that life, that might take the pleaſures of this life: But to a dejected heart whoſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht content could promiſe no wiſhed delight; there a cloſe priſon was better then a glorious Pallace. To travail (ſhe ſaid) to my <hi>Paris;</hi> would be more pleaſing then painfull to <hi>Vienna;</hi> but not knowing where he is, I might perhaps extravagantly go further from him then I am, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this concluſion he parted, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſtrewed the ruſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This made her heart-burning hate to proſecute her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: And though ſhe had no cauſe to fear her, (for occaſion never yet made her her enemy) yet could ſhe not indure to think that ſhe ſhould be ſubject to another, that now was moſt eminent in her ſelf.</p>
            <p>To have the Regent was all her ambitious deſire, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did let but <hi>Vienna's</hi> right; To fruſtrate which, ſhe with fulneſſe of Gold, and promites of preferment had as aforeſaid ſeduced this mettle-minded Servant, to deceive and to deſtroy her by ſuch ſubtile and obſcure meanes, as both gave leaſt ſhew of miſtruſt, and moſt likelihood of execution; And this it was.</p>

               <hi>Don Poltron</hi> (for ſo was he rightly named) bringing <hi>Vienna's</hi> mornings repaſt to her, with a bemoaning tongue, and a ſighing heart, complained much againſt Nature, and envyed more againſt Fortune, that had made beauty ſo miſerable and vertue ſo unhappy, as to entomb the glory of the one and the efficacy of the other, in ſo unprofitable, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable place.

               <hi>Vienna</hi> liking his generous nature, judged by his diſcreet and relenting diſcourſe that he was well bred, and pleaſing witty; and therefore required him to tell what was his name, and where he was born: who anſwered, <hi>Don Poltron</hi> am I called, and in <hi>Spain</hi> was my birth; my education was better then my fortune, and this my ſervile Place bears now record of my ſiniſter fate.</p>
            <p>Why, ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> if thou be infortunate, keep ſtill thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, here is a place of woe and thou haſt a Princeſs to aſſociate thee in thy ſorrows: Haſt thou cauſe to bewail thy miſhaps? Let us know thy croſſes, and we will eaſe thee with our grief; For it is a comfort to find a companion in miſery.</p>
            <p>Then ſay <hi>Poltron</hi> (for thy Nature agrees better with us, then thy Name) and ſtory to us the life of thy Fortune, that we may alſo recreate our mind, by liſtening to thy griefs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poltron</hi> having pleaſed her with this ſugered Bayt, caſt out his hidden Hook, and told her that he was a rich Merchants Son in <hi>Spain,</hi> left ſo well Treaſured, that he ſwayed the world a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Unto her (ſaid he) I ſued long for obtained grace; which had, I held my ſelf more fortunately happy, then <hi>Paris</hi> did in the fruition of his Love. <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> what <hi>Paris? Paris</hi> (ſaid he) of <hi>Troy,</hi> that enjoyed the Beauty of <hi>Greece,</hi> and made his Pleaſure a Plague to his Country.</p>
            <p>But in the height of my joyes, and hope of higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Death deprived me of my Paradiſed Bliſs, and not only made my broken heart the ſad habitation of woe, but alſo tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my mind (which before was a Kingdom to me) into a Hell of tormenting thoughts.</p>
            <p>The place of my birth grew (by her loſs) ſo hatefull to me, that I was neceſſitated to forgo the ground that yielded me no other Harveſt but grief.</p>
            <p>In brief, for better portage, I turned all my Subſtance into Jewels of eſtimate, and travelled to <hi>Naples,</hi> where I ſpent more of my wealth, then I did of my woes.</p>

               </gap>n Repentance made me leave that waſtfull Nation, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59993:64"/>ſo I came unfortunately into <hi>France.</hi> Thus he drew on her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with a faigned tale, that he might without all ſuſpition and with better gain of belief, give more fewell to her deſire, for his further betraying diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And to blind all jealous thoughts, he purpoſely ſeemed by his abrupt end, to be unwilling to proceed further. But <hi>Vienna</hi> (whoſe croſſed affection delighted to hear of ſemblable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes) would needs know what other miſhaps waited on his loſt love.</p>
            <p>Alas Madame, ſaid <hi>Poltron,</hi> the ſmall remainder of my broken ſtate I brought with me into <hi>France,</hi> to maintein the length of my days; but in my paſſage, I was ſet on by four Theeves, that ſtript me of all I had, and wounded me ſore, and would no doubt have taken my life, but that by chance there came by a poor <hi>Hermite,</hi> who ſeeing their violence, without all dread of their number, or fear of his own feebleneſs, caſt off his peacefull Gown, and drawing out a hidden ſword out of his ſtaffe, he ſo fiercely aſſaulted them, that in the end he ſlew three of them, whileſt the fourth run away with the prey, the danger of my wounds made him then as far to ſurmount him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in pitty, as he had excelled the other in valour: And in the tenderneſs of his relenting mind, he brought me to his Cell, where on a bed of moſs he laid me; and binding up my wounds with a piece of his ſhirt (for other linnens he had none) he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards applyed the juyce of hearbs ſo oft unto them, that they healed, and I began to grow ſtrong.</p>
            <p>With him had I continued ſtill, but that during the ſtay of my recovery, I could not endure to ſee this good Chyrurgion, and noble minded <hi>Hermite,</hi> that had ſo well preſerved and cheriſhed me, ſit ſo oft ſighing, and many times exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt unjuſt rigour; &amp; unnaturall injuſtice; that half diſtraught, he would often confuſedly ſay; Doth the Sea nouriſh a more cruell fiſh then the <hi>Dolphin?</hi> Is not <hi>Vienna</hi> the faireſt City of the world? And lived there ever a more unfortunate man then <hi>Paris.</hi> Then would he bewayl deſtroyed <hi>Troy,</hi> and blame Love that fired <hi>Illion;</hi> and by and by curſe that wretched Knight that overthrew ſo fair a Creature, and ſo glorious a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59993:64"/>Then would he ſit in a dolefull dump, and after ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtart up as one affrighted, and accuſe his offending tongue of treachery, for wronging the divine name of love, ſince he was ſo highly beloved, as his mean fortune merited not the glory thereof.</p>
            <p>But leaving him (with my Prayers) both to his Cave, and to his Cell; after many thanks, I left that wofull and worthy Hermit, and came to <hi>Viennois,</hi> where neceſſity compelled me to ſeek this ſervice. And this moſt vertuous Princeſſe is the Map of my miſery; and ſo he ſeemed to end before he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; that the Fiſh might bite the more eagerly, when the bayt was pulled away: But oh, ſaid <hi>Vienna</hi> (for now ſhe had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the hidden, and hurtfull hook) didſt thou not perceive the cauſe of his ſo ſecret and ſo great a grief? Yes, Noble Lady, ſaid <hi>Poltron.</hi> Time and Occaſion gave me meanes to know the ſame; then good <hi>Poltron,</hi> let me intreat thee ſhe ſaid, to relate the full diſcourſe thereof. For ſuch ſubjects of woe beſt fitteth wofull minds, and cauſes of dolor and calamity, are ever moſt pleaſing to perplexed perſons. <hi>Poltron</hi> thus halled on, to ſet the trap, that ſhould enſnare her life, thus cunningly gave fire to her tinder.</p>
            <p>Though, ſaid he, I am unwilling to ingrieve my thoughts with the ſad remembrance of my friends over-grievous ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; yet ſince it is your pleaſure, your will commands my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>Then know, moſt faireſt of fair Ladyes, that after I had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times obſerved the frenzy of his paſſions: and wondring, had noted his broken and diſconſonant complaints he being at other times moſt adviſedly wiſe, and moſt humbly (though ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) patient; As we were ſitting at the mouth of his Cave, chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the miſeries of this life, and the croſſes of this uncertain world, I requeſted him in favour of my deſire, to recount unto me, the cauſe of his ſo often paſſionate laments. In anſwer wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſaid.</p>
            <p>Though my grief be already ſuch as there can be no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſo great an extream; and though my wounds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be healed, becauſe they may not be ſearched, yet to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59993:65"/>give thee ſome content, know that not far from <hi>Tolledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> I ſerved not long ſince a great and mighty Lord, called <hi>Don Daulphinatus;</hi> who had one only Daughter named <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris-enna,</hi> whoſe beauty was far fairer then the Evening Star, and whoſe vertue was more powerfull then the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation.</p>
            <p>By her ſweet influence did I only live and breath; and though my mean fortune durſt not gaze on ſo bright a Planet, yet did her gracious aſpect both ſo ennoble, and inable my towring thoughts, that unknown, I atchieved in honour of her name, many admired exploits.</p>
            <p>After ſome ſeaſon, both my acts, and my love, were acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally made known to her, who in time made me (though moſt unworthy) the Maſter of her deſires, that was, and ſtill am, a ſervant to her will. Our mutuall minds thus combined, was like the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein grew more delights, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature now affords, or Art can expreſs. Our hearts fed on pleaſures, our eyes beheld the bliſs of each other, and in the full comfort of all content, did we ſleep in love; and wake, and walk, in all fulneſs of joy. From this Paradiſe, were we driven by felonious Fortune, who envying our happineſs, would not ſuffer that we ſhould make this Earth our Heaven, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore curſt for our ſins.</p>
            <p>My Lord, her Father, had hnowledge thereof, who finding my indignity not worthy of ſuch ſoveraignty, was ſo carryed away with diſdainfull ſcorn, and irefull diſpleaſure, that he doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me to death, if ever I were found within the precinct of his command.</p>
            <p>This ſeparation (for now I was put to my flight) was ſuch a coraſive to both our confounded ſoules, that ſhe ſtaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a greater miſery, the deprivation of life, and I wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in unknown paths, to ſeek after a wiſhed death.</p>
            <p>Long was my travail and manifold my fortunes: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance of place, continuance of travail, happineſſe of fortune, nor tract of time, could free my fancy, nor weary ine from my conſtant affection. At laſt, being both wearied and nighted, I came to this harmleſſe Ceill; where in love
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59993:65"/>of Solitarineſs and in contempt of the world, I vowed to ſpend the unſpent ſorrowes of my Life, and keepe my ſelfe from the knowledge of Men: and thereupon he devoutly ſwore me that I ſhould not make his private aboad known unto any Man.</p>
            <p>Whereat the wounded Princeſſe, in her apprehenſion, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and watered the floore with her baulmy Tear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh how rightly did the Deſtinies Chriſten him: and how truely doth his Name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his fate; for grief hath but a dead heart, and hapleſs love none at all. But where is that place of plaint, that ſo confines ſorrow in it ſelf, and makes woe a habitation for ſo miſerable a Man? Tell me, oh tell me, that I may ſend ſome ſanctified perſon to comfort him, and wean him from ſo wretched a life.</p>
            <p>My Oath (anſwered <hi>Poltron,</hi>) will not admit, that any man by my means ſhould know thereof. Then would I were (ſhe ſaid) with him my ſelf, for by his Name (I now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) he is that Divining Man that hath revealed Wonders, and can tell what ſhall befall every one: Oft have I heard of him, and ſtrange things by him foretold have come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus did they both diſguiſe their minds, and with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Morter daub uptheir ſeverall concealed meanings, and hidden intentions, that they might both the better work out their Advantages. But <hi>Poltron</hi> ſeeing his venomous Plot had (without all ſuſpect) thus poyfoned her belief; boldly told her, That as ſhe was no <hi>Man,</hi> ſhe was not within the Condition of his Bond, and therefore (if ſo ſhe pleaſed) he would not onely give her full Liberty, but alſo bring her unknown to that hapleſſe Hermite, whom ſhe deſired ſo much to ſee, provided that ſhe ſhould give him Gold, to bring him after to his Native Home, and alſo be directed by him, both for the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59993:66"/>means and the manner of their eſcape and travail. To this, ſhe anſwered that priſons were no Treaſure-houſes, and that ſhe had no Mint to anſwer her mind; onely ſome reſerved Iewels ſhe had, which ſhe would give him.</p>
            <p>It ſhall (ſaid he) ſuffice; Pitty pleads in your behalf, your merit claims redreſſe, and my feeling grief to ſee a Princeſſe ſo diſtreſt, commands the hazard of my life. Be you but ſilent and ſecret, and you ſhall ſee, that I will deceive the waking eyes of encharged wiſedome, and overthrow the heedfull care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed truſt: And thus it muſt be: By the print of the keys (which I will make in Wax) will I make other like keys, by which all the doors ſhall congee to your will, and give paſſage to your pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Then will I have you for your better ſecurity homely atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with a box under your arm, and Bone-lace hanging out of it, a pair of ſhears tied to your Girdle, and a yard in your hand, that you may ſeem to be not what you are, but what in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance I would have you ſhew to be. And I will with a Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars pack on my back, well ſuited thereunto, travell along with you as your husband: So ſhall we both better eſcape and avoid ſuſpition,</p>
            <p>But how, ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſhall <hi>Izabella</hi> beſtow her ſelf? She, ſaid <hi>Poltron,</hi> muſt ſtay behind in priſon, to take away the knowledge of our flight; For after our departure ſhe muſt lock the door again, keep your bed with the Curtaines drawn, and lay your clothes by, moſt in ſight; and when any comes into her, ſhe muſt carefully ſay, that you are not well, and that you are laid down to ſleep So ſhall we gain time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our haſty purſuits, and ſhe may after at her will repair to ſome private friend, in ſuch diſguiſe as I will provide for her.</p>
            <p>That (ſaid <hi>Vienna</hi>) may not be; for I will never leave her, that hath never forſaken me; nor will I without her, venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſuch adventure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poltron</hi> ſeeing it would not otherwiſe bee, yeelded, though unwilling thereunto, and like Sinnes Sollicitour, moved, that <hi>Izabella</hi> would play the Pedlar, and he would
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59993:66"/>become a Tinker, with his Budget on his back, a leathern couloured Apron before him, a Hammer under his Girdle, and a Brazen ladle in one of his hands; And thus with his face beſmeared, would he go a pretty way before them, as none of their company, and yet guide them in the way. So gallant a Bonelace-ſeller, ſo proud a Pedlet, and ſo ſtout a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, all <hi>France</hi> will not pattern; But thus it muſt be, if you Madam, will have your deſire; Nor may you ſcorn that means that promiſeth aſſurance of Liberty, and hope of better hap.</p>
            <p>The Gods to have their wils, diſdained not the ſhape of beaſts, and we muſt with the cunning Fowler, cloath our ſelves in Feathers, if we will deceive wily birds. It is a Soare, no ſinne, to betray Tyranny; but a ſhift, no ſhame; to get Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>Theſe guilefull enticing words of his, and the betraying inſtructions of the deepe deceitefull <hi>Dolphinis,</hi> were (without any ſemblance of other reach) ſo ſmoothly, and paſſionately delivered, by this damnable and perfideous Villain, that all his wily words were held as Oracles, and the further he ſeemed to be from her, the neerer ſtill he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her to the quick: In ſo much, that <hi>Vienna</hi> being blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led in her over-affectionate deſire, beyond the limit of all due conſideration, yeelded to referre her ſelf to his truſt, and to faſhion themſelves according to his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Alaſſe <hi>Vienna,</hi> where diſloyall Treaſon threatens thy ſhipwrack, and where remorceleſſe murder is thy plot; there aſſured danger muſt be thy Harbour, and reproachfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thy hoſt: Implacable malice purſues thee; inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fraud bettayes thee, and too late repentance, will I fear, learn thee, that they are moſt miſerable, that make themſelves wretched examples to others. But how ſhould Love (the child of Folly) looke into a plot of pollicy, when unſeduced wit cannot ſee it, nor untainted wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome find it. The appearance of Truth, and the ſhew of Pitty, and ſimplicity, hath in all deceitfull Practiſes, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59993:67"/>Cities, depoſed Kings, defrauded Subjects of their rights, and taken away the guiltleſſe lives of Innocents. How then poor Princeſs, couldſt thou a voyd thy running upon the Sands, though armies of objections did riſe againſt thy doubtfull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; yet cannot thy good, though free intention, make thee faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though thy over-credulity in entertaining of conjectures made thee erre. Thy chaſt thoughts ſhine ſtill. I ſee, in thy vertue; and thy vertue (by divine providence) muſt ſhield thee both from abuſive ſhame, and from unexpected ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Poltron</hi> had provided at <hi>Vienxa's</hi> coſt all materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ala; and the Ladies diſrobeing themſelves, hid their attyres, and to caſt a miſt before the eyes of ignorance, they clothed them to the purpoſe, and at ſupper time, the night being dark, upon <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi> watch-word, who then ſtood centinell, they came forth, pulling the door after them; For lock it, <hi>Vienna</hi> would not becauſe it ſhould appear which way they came forth, leaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further rearch they might find out <hi>La-nova</hi>'s private way, and ſo bring him into trouble, who at the time was in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders enquiring after his loſt friend.</p>
            <p>The next morning their eſcape was diſcovered, the City was ſearched, <hi>Poltron</hi> miſt, and every way was full of inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. But that nights travell, and their unſuſpected diſguiſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſuall habit of ſuch wandring profeſſours) brought them ſafe unto a great wood, that ſtood at the foot of a high hill in <hi>Langnedoc,</hi> where he perſwaded them the <hi>Hermit</hi> had his Cell.</p>
            <p>At the entrance whereof, <hi>Vienna</hi> ſtumbled; the dull earth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding thereby her further paſſage; and <hi>Izabella</hi>'s eyes were ſuddenly for the time ſtrucken blind; as though the feet of the one, were unwilling to bring their Miſlris into perill: and the eyes of the other were aſhamed to ſee ſuch intended villany. But no preſage can foreſtall deſire, love looks altogether after their own fancies, &amp; conſters all things acccording to her affections This helhound, (the Divels Agent) ſeeing <hi>Vienna</hi> ready to fall, ſtept to her, and taking her by the arm, in ſhew to ſupport her, led her into the thickeſt of the wood, where ſuddenly as one
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59993:67"/>transformed, this ſeeming dove ſhewed himſelf a villture; and like cruelty her ſelf, with imboſſed mouth and ſtaring eyes, he drew his ſhort ſword that hung by his luſtfull ſide, and gaſhly ſwore, that if either of them made any noiſe, he would forthwith kill them both: whereat the weak and wearied Ladies, were ſo amazed, that all their ſences were ſenceleſſe, their tongues were bound to the peace by iuſtice fear; they could not ſpeak, nor durſt not cry.</p>
            <p>Now Luſt, the (execrable parent of murther) ſeeing her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed beauty ſhine like the ſun through a Cloud, had ſo fiered his fancy, that where before it was but kindled by her looks, now having her within his power it did violently burn by the touch. Death muſt now forbear, and attend his pleaſure for his pleaſure; and nothing could ſatisfie this covetuous Fox, but after the ſtealing of the grapes he meant to forrage the vine.</p>
            <p>To effect which, he turned <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s face to a tree, and bound her arms round about the ſame, and notwithſtanding flatteringly promiſed them both their lives, if <hi>Vienna</hi> would but conſent to his wanton wil; If not, he then prodigally ſwore, that in diſpight of all he would gather the fruit, now it was ripe, and after leave their ſlain bodyes a prey unto the beaſts ofthe field. <hi>Vienna</hi> having recovered ſome ſpirit, and ſeeing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger, with elevated eys, erected hands, and bowed knees, ſhe beſought him not to ſport in her miſery, nor to ſpot his ſoul with the repenting pleaſure of uncleannes. Remember ſayd ſhe, that I am a Princeſſe, ſave but my honour, as thou art my mothers ſon, and I will freely forgive thee my death, as I am my fathers daughter.</p>
            <p>I ſeek not life, but the honour of my life; for my long liv'd grief, makes me hate life, and deſpiſe death, but in the loſſe of my chiefeſt cheriſhed care, my curſes ſhall poyſon thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the wildfire of thy luſt, ſhall burn up all thy worldly welfare, and make thee a ſpeedy prey to ſpeedy deſtruction. O let then my Chaſt teares quench the flame of thy ſinfull Concupiſcence; biaſt not the beauty of the Lilly in the bud; deprive not the Roſe of the fairneſs of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59993:68"/>bloom; nor brand not thy ſelf with the curſed name of a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full villain. The fierceſt Lyon hath no cruelty to hurt a Royall Virgine; Man was made to help not to hurt a ſilly maid; and the Lord of Hoſts, hath countleſſe Plagues to puniſh ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. Thy carnall regard is but momentary, but thy ſhamſe will be everlaſting, and thy puniſhment eternall; For repentance follows fruition; and the reward of ſin is death. Thus did ſhe pray, plead, and entreat, and thus would ſhe have diſſwaded him from doing evill, that never yet knew good, but his unruly paſſion, and thirſt of blood, could brook neither interceſſion, nor interruption.</p>
            <p>His hot untarned deſires prayd in ayd of force, which made her ſhreek, &amp; call ful loud on Gods Juſtice for helpful revenge; when ſuddenly the angry heavens began to make war againſt him, and to threaten him with a terrible voyce, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth ſuch fearfull thunder, lightning, and powerfull ſtormes, that force perforce he was enforced to deſiſt for the time.</p>
            <p>But as the wofull Ladyes continued ſtill their ſhouting cryes; It fortuned that two Peaſants that had Pomage in the wood, had been ſeeking of their ſwine, who by violence of the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Skies, and wrathfull Elements, had taken ſhelter under a Tree. As thus they ſilent ſtood, praying for preſervation, they heard their diſmall cries, and haſting (for ſo their good Angels would) toward the place of plaint, they found the obdurate Traytor attempting a freſh aſſault; which made, the ſwifter Man comming in with his Batte, to make him looſe his laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hold.</p>
            <p>This happy accident revived the dying heart of <hi>Vienna</hi> and the guilty dread of <hi>Poliron,</hi> fearing to be taken, made him ſo deſperate, that he both wounded and grounded the gentle Peaſant; and as he endeavoured to take away his life, the other comming in, knockt out his brarnes. This ſpeedy diſpatch gave the Divell his due, and freed the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinis</hi> of all ſuſpect, who otherwiſe had by Drugge taken order for his perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               </gap> concealments. The Ladies thus ſuccoured, freed, and comforted prayſed God for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59993:68"/>and thanked the poor Men for their aſſiſtance; And in guerdon of their ſo happy ſervice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot knowing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe how to requite ſo great a good, they wiſhed (concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves) that they would bring them to the Governor of <hi>Viennois,</hi> who they knew would bountifully reward them.</p>
            <p>The uncapable Peaſants, ſmiling thereat, told them, that they would not for <hi>Jaſons</hi> labour, ſeek after <hi>Coridons</hi> hyre: for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (ſaid they) ſo unremarkable can neither pleaſure nor profit greatneſſe of State. To which, the Princeſſe anſwered, that by her means they ſhould deliver into his hands the two Ladyes that were committed to his charge, and that lately conveyed themſelves out of priſon.</p>
            <p>This golden hope did win their conſents, and not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed them in their travel, but alſo gave ſpeed to their journy: Only it contented <hi>Vienna,</hi> that ſhe ſhould by this meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite her preſervers, though thereby ſhe made her ſelf a thrall to time and tyranny. Liberty could give her no comfort, nor could ſhe tell how better to diſpoſe of her loathed life, then to make her ſelf a priſoner to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fortune:</hi> the care ſhe had of <hi>Iſabella</hi> made her the more ſenſitive of her wrongs; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turning toward her, ſhe ſoftly ſaid; Though the fruit of the O life tree come late, yet is the liquor both good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>The tyde now ſerveth, my dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> take thou the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof, and at laſt free thy ſelf from participating of my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woes: <hi>Fortune</hi> hath bound my life prentiſe to her frowns, and I am reſolved to ſerve out my time; then leave me to my fate, and get thee to ſome more happy place, where my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thy more fortunate friends, may purchaſe thee more content.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s impearled teares did publiſh her miſlike, and in her griefe ſhe ſaid, that love never thought that time too long, that did hang on deſert; and that ſorrowes growne to a cuſtome, were pleaſing to miſerable Creatures; Then what ſhould ſeparate my attendance from your Grace, ſince without you I cannot live, and with you I mean to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59993:69"/>dye. <hi>Vienna</hi> thanking her, joyed no little in her conſtant ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: For Friendſhip is ever moſt ſweeteſt, when, Fortune is moſt ſowreſt.</p>
            <p>Thus as they chatted, they came to <hi>Viennois,</hi> where ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed their two good conductors, to wait for the Governours going to the Church, and then boldly to ſtep to him, and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to proffer him the delivery of the Princeſſe and her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which done you ſhall privately bring us unto him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom we will preſent what we have promiſed</p>
            <p>The Peaſants promiſe (having done according to inſtruction) made the Governor to rejoyce ſo at the newes, that he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to his houſe, and ſent one of them for the Princeſſe, who yet was not knowne to be the Princeſſe. Upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>Vienna</hi> with ſhew of Majeſty, thus greeted the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Let not my Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> wonder at our diſguiſe, nor queſtion the cauſe: it may ſuffice, you have your Priſoners, and we are content with our alotments: Reward well theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt perſons, that with hazard of their lives, have not onely preſerved our honors and lives, but alſo freed you from many cares, and ſaved you perhaps from dangerous troubles. This is all our deſires, we know your charge, and willingly yeeld to your diſpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Governor baring (in due reverence) his aged head with more tears of pitty then of joy, reſpectively ſaluted them, and giving the Peaſants ſtore of Crowns, humbly and courteouſly he brought the Ladyes to their carefull Chamber, where we will leave them to learn of <hi>Sirap,</hi> what ſucceſs waited on his <hi>Babylonian</hi> endeavours.</p>
            <p>Now had time, and travell, brought <hi>Sirap</hi> (whom we left in his journey) unto <hi>Babylon;</hi> where the <hi>Soldan</hi> (to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Turk,</hi> and to ſhew his love to Vertue, and his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of merit) entertained him with all magnificence, and variety of Kingly delights. But after they had feaſted, and ſpent ſome dayes in Courtly ſports: <hi>Sirap</hi> being mindfull of his Lord, deſired to ſee the City, with ſuch Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Antiquityes, as were therein; which ſo well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59993:69"/>pleaſed the <hi>Soldan,</hi> that to honour him the more, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him in perſon, ſtill ſhewing him by his interpreter, all ſuch places of note and worth, as then were there remaining: At length they paſt by, (for ſo their paſſage lay) the Caſtle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Dolphin</hi> was impriſoned.</p>
            <p>Which Sir <hi>Sirap</hi> long viewing, commended, and in his praiſe thereof demanded by his Interpreter, what Caſtle or Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace that was, that was ſo well ſcituated, ſo ſtately built, and of ſuch ſtrength. And they told him that it was <hi>Mount Seme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> built of old by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> Queen unto the firſt great King of the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy,</hi> and that as then, there lay as Priſoner one of the greateſt Princes of <hi>France</hi> in the Weſtern clime; known by the name of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeemed much to wonder both at the name and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as unheard of before, and therefore was deſirous to ſee the ſtature, favour, carriage and manner of thoſe men; and to learn, if he could, the nature, law, religion, cuſtom, and ſtate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which ſtood ſo well with the <hi>Soldans</hi> liking, that both in one deſire, went to the Caſtle to ſee, and to confer with the <hi>Dolphin,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap</hi> building on <hi>Bonſoyes</hi> fidelity, as having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what poſſeſt him with his purpoſe, and wrought him to his wil; did uſe him as Interpreter betwixt him and the <hi>Dolphin:</hi> For he would not altogether, yet diſcover himſelf to <hi>Bonſoy,</hi> and therefore ſpeaking to him in Greek, he commanded that he ſhould ſalute the <hi>Dolphin</hi> in his name, and tell him that as a ſtranger he was come to ſee him, and of meat humanity to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him; which the <hi>Dolphin</hi> kindly accepting, as kindly regree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and entertained him with all the gracious remonſtrances he could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> bad him then ask what his country was, howgreat; by what lawes they were governed, under what title they were ſubjected, what Religion they obſerved and what God they chiefly adored, unto which the <hi>Dolphin</hi> thus briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> he ſaid is my native neſt, both moſt populous and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59993:70"/>ſpacious, as having in it 27 thouſand Pariſh Churches; It is moſt fertile; and abounds in all plentifulneſs of fruits, wines, ſalt, corn, fiſh and wild fowl; There are many Vniverſities famous therein (the nurſing mothers of all vertue) out of whoſe breaſts, youth draws out the knowledge of all arts; It hath many large Provinces; and divers bordering Principallityes owe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereunto: The Cityes are great and many; rich in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and fair, and uniforme in building; the chief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is <hi>Paris,</hi> famous for beauty and bigneſſe: the uſuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of the King, and great traſſique of all kind of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</p>
            <p>Our Lawes are termed the civill Lawes, wherein Juſtice is tempered, and qualified by equity and conſcience; and equity and conſcience are garded and maintained with Juſtice. Our Monarch is entituled a King, the moſt Chriſtian King of France, under, whoſe protection his people live ſecure, injoying their own, and under whoſe Greatneſſe, his Subjects reſt fearleſſe of forraign foes.</p>
            <p>Our Religion is built upon Gods ſacred word; Truth is the root thereof, Charity the branch, and good works the fruit. Our Paſtors are our Teachers, who like Lamps conſume themſelves to enlighten others; their Doctrine is examined by the twelve Apoſtles: Our prayers by Chriſt taught ſix Petitions: Our Faith by the generall Greed; and our lives by Gods tenne Commandements. And where the tongue of <hi>Aaron</hi> cannot perſwade, there the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth correct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</p>
            <p>We ſerve and worſhip one onely God in perſons three, not confuſed, nor divided; but diſtinct: of one and the ſame divine Eſſence, eternity, power, and quality. God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghoſt. The father being the firſt, chief, and originall cauſe of all things; The Sun his word and eternall wiſedom: and the Holy Ghoſt his power, vortue, and efficacy. This is that God, that by his Word made the glorious Globe his ſeat, and the maſſie earth his footſtoole; that fed his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (the unprovided Iſraelites) with food from Heaven, forty yeares in the Wilderneſſe; that divided the Waters,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59993:70"/>and brought them dry-foot through the Red-Sea, and drencht proud <hi>Pharoh</hi> therein, that purlued them with a murdering heart. To him we offer no burnt-offerings, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of blood, but the ſweet interceſſion of devout prayers. For thoſe ceremonies ceaſed at the comming of Chriſt, by whom we are called Chriſtians; and we are received into his Church by baptiſme, and continued and fed therein by the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his laſt Supper,</p>
            <p>And ſuch is our Country, theſe our Lawes, ſuch our King, this our Religion, and this the God we onely ſerve, love, fear and adore. <hi>Sirap</hi> thanked him for his good deſcription, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take pleaſure in the knowledge thereof. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how he brookt his Captivity, and he anſwered like a Prince, and therefore like himſelf; as one ſubject to chance, and reſolved in the change. Then he bad him ask whether he had any children, and he all ſighing ſaid, but one onely daughter. Then <hi>Sirap</hi> cauſed him to ask why he then ſo ſighed; and he replying ſaid, that his ſole ſouls grief conſiſted in her memory, and ſo made manifeſt his hard, cruell, and unnaturall dealing toward her; and how he had left her a priſoner to his tyranny, and therefore by divine juſtice made himſelf a priſoner to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> being thus certified, was well pleaſed that <hi>Vienna</hi> yet living, lived his permanent friend; and though he grieved much for her endurance, yet did he ſmother up his conceived ſorrow in the recordation of her love. The thought of his exile, and <hi>Vienna</hi>'s thraldome, awaked <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Anger</hi> (the ready Officers of Revenge) to haſten his death: but in the eye of his milder conſideration, knowing him to be his Lord, and <hi>Vienna</hi>'s father; his relenting heart checked his repining humor, and blew the coals of his hotter deſire, to ſeek, and to effect his ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
            <p>To compaſſe which he ſeeming (ſeemed of purpoſe) to take pleaſure in him, and underſtanding of his Countries cuſtomes, commodityes, and government. And therefore he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Soldan</hi> for the continuance of his contentment, and for his further knowledge of forraign affairs, to admit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The two next dayes <hi>Sirap</hi> ſpent in covertly revealing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his expertneſſe, and carriage, did both win reſpect, and gave delight. The third following day, he with his Interpretour went to parley with the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> who deſpairing of life, they ſound expecting death. But after they had greeted, and regree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each other, with kind ſalutes, <hi>Sirap</hi> told him by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, that as a man he bewailed his fortune; and as he was a Prince, he lamented his fall.</p>
            <p>Yet diſmay not noble Lord, ſaid he, ſince all corporall da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, that happen to mortall men, are either by means reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, by reaſon ſuffered, by time cured, or by death ended. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and violent ſtorms may for the time cleave the bark from the tree, and rent the branches of his body; yet for all the furious blaſts of wrathfull winds, it cannot be pluckt up by the root. If there be a power above the capacity of men then may there come comfort, contrary to the conceit of men. Expectation in a weak mind, makes an evil greater, and a good leſſe: but the reſolved mind digeſts an evill being come, and makes a future good preſent before it come; Then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the beſt, ſince you know the worſt at the worſt, will have an end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> conceiting the civill demeanour, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall diſcourſe, and the pious mind of the ſuppoſed impious and barbarous Moor, honoured his mild inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wondered at his regular admonitions, ond thanked him for his human comforts and tender regard. My mind, mindfull (ſaid <hi>Sirap</hi>) of Fortunes fickleneſſe, affects (I know not how, nor wherefore) your deliverance: what then will the <hi>Dolphin</hi> give, if I affect the ſame? The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> whoſe ſmalleſt ſayles of hope, the leaſt winds did blow, offered the third part of his Principallity, when he ſhould
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59993:71"/>come to <hi>Viennois.</hi> Promiſes, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> of advancement, are no aſſurances of enrichment, and he hath a wit too ſhort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that will loſe certain favours, for uncertain fortunes.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, if you will but ſwear unto me by that ſame God, which you ſerve and adore, to grant me one requeſt, that I ſhall make when I come to <hi>Viennois,</hi> I will indanger my life to free your life from danger; and leave, and loſe my honours in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> to ſeal and ſeat my ſelf with you in <hi>France;</hi> more you cannot deſire, leſſe (my Country-Gods ayding me) I will not accompliſh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> whoſe flattering hope, ſuddainly gave him a preſent aſſay of future happineſſe, though at the firſt he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credulous in entertaining ſuch favourable conjectures, yet hardly could he ground any firm belief, ſince knowing him to be but a Stranger, he thought that ſuch deep wounds could not be ſearched with ſuch ſhallow Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>But at the laſt, referring all things to God, and to the Will and Wiſdom of the ſuppoſed Moor, he wholly embraced his kind offer, and anchored all his hopes, in his provident indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: unto whom, preferring life before livelyhood, he devoutly ſware by his Fathers. God, the onely one true God, and God of all Gods, in whom he chiefly, and only truſted; that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he would demand, ſhould be freely, abſolutely, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given him, In further conſideration whereof, he gave him a rich Diamond, and his Interpretour a hundred French crowns; which for his uſe, if need required, he had cloſely hid betwixt the lyning of the coller of his doublet. <hi>Sirap</hi> holding himſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſaid, it ſufficed.</p>
            <p>Only he required his continual prayers for his better ſucceſs, and ſo left him, to feaſt his hopefull heart with the expectation of deſired ſucceſs. The next day, <hi>Sirap</hi> taking occaſion to walk to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that famous River that runs by <hi>Babylon,</hi> there to view the variety of ſtrange and ſeverall ſmall ſhips, he caſually met, and ſecretly compounded with an ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Pylot, whoſe corruption being gilded over with gold; he was to bring him down the River through the Perſian
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59993:72"/>gulfe to the next Port town upon the <hi>Affrick</hi> ſhore: the fifth following night he appointed to come aboard, attended onely with two men, and therefore gave him in charge, not onely to be moſt ſecret therein, but alſo that he ſhould make full provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all requiſites.</p>
            <p>This done, he preſently gave forth that he would ſhortly depart, and return to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and the better to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſire without miſdeem: he determined (under colour of preparation, and fitly furniſhing himſelf) to lye ſome few dayes in the City, before he would embarque him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>All which he preſently imparted to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and humbly with prodigall thanks took his leave, ſaying, that his period of time, pleaded now his promiſed return, which in no wiſe he would violate with the high Commander of his thoughts, the great and Emperiall Turk, unto whom he owed all obliged love, and moſt reverend reſpect. And therefore, if ſo it pleaſed his Majeſty to conmand his ready ſervice in ought, he would willingly attend his pleaſure, and by his Graces imployments, hold himſelf more then graced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soldan</hi> ſeeing he would depart, preſented him with many rich gifts of Royall eſtimate, holding himſelf no little bounden to his Gods, in that they had intereſted him in ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; meritorious a friend, ſo blinded was he with <hi>Siraps</hi> civill demeanour, and ſo dusked with <hi>Solimans</hi> powerful commends, that he could not with <hi>Palamedes,</hi> pry into the profundity of <hi>Vlyſſes;</hi> and therefore requeſting him to take in worth thoſe ſmall remembrances of his faſt ſealed love, he friendly bad him farewell, and ſo left him,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> whoſe thoughts travelled now in queſt after the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> deliverance, got himſelf into the City, where he cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered himſelf in a Merchants houſe of great and good regard, where being once left and ſeated, he began to call his wits to account, how beſt he might beſt deceive the <hi>Dolphins</hi> Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>For providence preventeth misfortunes, and gives life to our future actions; And therefore he was neither careleſly, nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timerouſly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59993:72"/>ſuſpitious of that, which might ſiniſterly and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſucceed; but jealous, and heedfull in the hazard, leaſt any over-ſight might croſſe his endeavours, and ſo leave his Lord helpleſs, and himſelf hapleſs. But after he had ſtretcht and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his wit, and ſet al poſſibilities on the rack of his invention; at length his deſire carrying him beyond all doubt of danger; he armed his determination with ſteeled reſolution, and ſetting his chance on the dice, he thus at tempted, and aſsayed his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>The day before his departure, he went unto the Caſtle, where gently greeting the Keeper, he told him that he was to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and therefore finding himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to him for his willing paines, and already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kindneſses, he was come of purpoſe in perſon to invite him, and all his followers (unto whom he had been trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome) to ſup with him that night, that he thereby might acknowledge his thankfulneſs, and they have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his love, and his perſon: And becauſe (he ſaid) my Chamber is no receit, and that I am unwilling to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or offenſive to the Maſter of the houſe, let me entreat the uſe of the Caſtle, and ſo make you my Hoſt, and Gueſt at once.</p>
            <p>The Keeper blinded with his former bounty, ſecured by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and now drawne on, by the pleaſing ſhew of kind courteſie; knowing him (whom yet he never knew) to be of a vertuous diſpoſe, of great eſtimate, and highly favoured of the King; did freely, and gratefully offer himſelf, his ſervice, and the Caſtle at his command. The great unknown diſtance, betwixt the <hi>Dolphins</hi> and the <hi>Moors</hi> country climes, with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of each other, and the difference of their tongues could not make the gul'd keeper ſuſpitious, nor can cauſe him once to dream of deceitfull guile.</p>
            <p>This illuſion gave <hi>Sirap</hi> hope of happy ſucceſs, and therefore manifeſting his thankfulneſs with a rich Iewell, that he (giving) required that he would wear it for his ſake, he left him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally provided, what either his purſe could procure, or the time would afford; hee alſo gave further charge to his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59993:73"/>that the Table ſhould be ſtill and ever fully furniſhed with many repleat cups of Greekiſh Wine. For (ſaid he) the coſt is ill ſpared; that is ſpared for coſt; and the beauty of the banquet is there ecclips'd, where <hi>Iupiter</hi> raines not down full ſhowres of <hi>Nectar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As himſelf, he had carefully and ſecretly before provided ſleeping Poppy, heavy Darnell, and the mortifiing juyce of life-bereaving Mandrake; with other powerfull powders, a ſmall quantity whereof taken in drink would make the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall into a moſt ſudden and deadly ſleep. This did he ſo ſecretly, and ſo frankly beſtow amongſt all the flaggon pots but one (which <hi>Bonfoy</hi> had in truſty charge reſerved by mark, for himſelf and his Lord) that every one had in ful meaſure his dormative full waight.</p>
            <p>Theſe poyſoned pots he cloſely kept for the middle of the banquet; and ſupper being ſerved in, <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeated every one in their due places, to the contentment of each one; &amp; then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feaſt, and chear his gladſome gueſts, and like a pleaſant Idoliſt, merrily cheered his feaſted friends. But in the end (they having no end in drinking) he ſeeing them ſo devoutly ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he to honor their Religion, added then more fatall fewell to their drunken fire.</p>
            <p>Their overdrawn cups were ſtill repleniſhed with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Wines, and ever he plyed them with cups, till their cups had over-plyed them: That drunk in their drowſie devotion, they falling into a leaden ſlumber, began to ſleep out all living conſideration.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeeing his hope honoured with ſome perfection thought it fit to do homage to opportunity; for in deferring of time, many times, it is both the loſſe of life, and occaſion: And therefore adding execution to time, he inſtantly went to make all ſuch as were in the Caſtle ſure; which done, he came back, and taking the keyes from the Keeper, (whom with the reſt of both their ſervants, we will leave where they ſilent lay) he haſtily went down to the <hi>Dolphins</hi> lodging, where they found him proſtrate on the ground, moyſtening the earth, with his repenting teares, and piercing the heavens with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59993:73"/>his prayers for the ſuppoſed Moors good ſucceſſe; but before he could make an end of his prayers, <hi>Sirap</hi> came to end his prayers, and Purgatory at once; and releaſing him from his oppreſſing Irons, brought him up to view <hi>Morphens</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which that dull God (with his ayd) had made, and prepared for his pleaſure.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus when our ſins are rips, and God to Justice bent,</l>
               <l>He turns our greateſt pleaſures to our juſt puniſhment.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now Time ſtruck his lock before, and it fitted not to argue what was done; or what was to be done, leaſt they themſelves might be undone; but giving praiſe to God in their ſeverall ſhewed kinds, they preſently buckled up their ſpirits with their legs, like Bees, that having ſuckt the juyce of forraign Gardens, make wing to their own hives, that they may make merry with the fraught of their adventures. So did they haſt to the back gate of the Caſtle, which they prizing open, went to the Rivers ſide, where the hired Pylot courteouſly attended their comming: In a ſmall veſſell they imbarqued themſelves, and ſayled to the <hi>Perſian Gulfe,</hi> and ſo a long to the <hi>Affrick</hi> Sea: Upon the entry whereof, there croſt them a great Pyrate of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whoſe uncheckt fortunes, and uncontrouled ſtrength ſtill crown'd his hardeſt attempts with victory.</p>
            <p>But his pride was now like a vapour, that aſcending high, ſoon turneth into ſmoak. For he no ſooner ſaw their ſmall Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, but counting it his purchaſe, he haſtily made towards them, and looking for no reſiſtance, he grapled with them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to yeeld.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sirap</hi> being unwilling to looſe the rich benefit of his high adventure, having no acquaintance with fear, and being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accuſtomed to conquer, drew forth his ſleeping Semitar, which his enraged fury whetted ſo ſharp; that he clove the firſt oppoſer down to the back, and ſent the head of the next, as an Ambaſſadour, to plead for peace amongſt the monſters of the Sea. The <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſeeing ſuch great chips cut out of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59993:74"/>ſuch rough timber, wondered at his force, and admired his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; Death ſeemed now to hold a Seſſions in the Ship, and <hi>Sirap</hi> ſtill gave the ſummons for their appearance. For fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring left their entry into his ſhip, ſhould endanger the <hi>Dolphin;</hi> he to prevent that, hazarded himſelf the more, by leaping in among his enemies, where his magnanimious mind, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the arm of puiſſance, ſo diſheartned his foes, that the Captain fearing leaſt any more ſhould come to aſſiſt him, cauſed the ſhips to be ungrapled: And no ſooner were they ſeparated, but that the timerous Pilot wherein the <hi>Dolphin</hi> was, ſeeing himſelfe ſevered from perill, began to turn the ſtern of his ſhip, and with a ſide wind to ſayl back; which <hi>Bonfoy</hi> eſpying, thought it better to dy in adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his liberty, then to become a Captive again to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Deſpair therefore made him valiant, and neceſſity did adde to his courage, which made him to exceed himſelf in might and to go beyond all hope in ſucceſſe: For ſuddenly running the Pilot thorow with his ſword, he wounded the next to him ſo ſore, that he could not offend. The <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſeeing the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his bold attempt, raiſed his faln courage to the height of noble reſolution; and unſheathing his quiet ſword, that <hi>Sirap</hi> had given him, he gave him ſuch aſſiſtance, as his weak abillity could afford.</p>
            <p>In the end, fear made them valiant, and their valour freed them from fear. The aſſaulted Saylers (being weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) fell in their bloud; and in their overthrowes, did the ſurvivours ſubmit themſelves to the mercy of their ſwords. Force now over-awed them, and they were compelled by <hi>Bonfoy</hi> to make towards the other Ship, wherein <hi>Sirap</hi> was making an end of an unequall battell. For having at the firſt ſlain their redoubted Captain, he wreſted his approved broad ſhield from him, under which ſhelter, his encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing valour made ſuch ſlaughter, as of ſixteen perſons, he left but three alive, which as <hi>Bonfoy</hi> came in, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on their knees for pardon. But when <hi>Sirap</hi> ſaw them, and underſtood of their interaccident, he was more
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59993:74"/>glad of their ſafeties, then he was of his own victory. The <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> ſtood amazed when he ſaw the Ship emboſt with ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heads, divided arms, and diſmembred legs; And in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſaid if he be but a man <hi>how this?</hi> If more then a man, <hi>why this?</hi> Such forceable blowes, ſhewes a power beyond all human power, and yet I ſee he is but a man, though he hath done much more then many men.</p>
            <p>This eſtimate of his valour and worth, made him over after reſpect him more for his incomparable proweſſe, then he did before for his deliverance. <hi>Bonfoy</hi> now thought himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in ſuch a Maſter, and <hi>Sirap</hi> grew proud of ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lovi</hi> (the joy of nature) now ſat in triumph for their ſecurities, and the wrathfull God of War, being wearied with deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, laid him down in the bed of peace: with theſe two ſhips they ſecurely ſayled, with winds ſuitable to their wills all along the coaſts of <hi>Magadoxa</hi> in <hi>Aethlopia,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Guine,</hi> where meeting with a Portugall Marchant, they hired the Pilot to bring them to <hi>Marſelles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the inſcrutable providence of God, from injurious and bad cauſes, produce good effects; making the baniſhment of the one to ſave the life of the other, and the love of liberty, to give liberty to love. The change that change of fortune wrought in them all, made their minds more then pleaſing Paradiſes of unſpeokable pleaſures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> dreamd of naught but Majeſty and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>Bonfoy</hi> of freedom and preferment; and <hi>Sirap</hi> his rich hopes promiſed him now golden fortunes: yet durſt he not unmask himſelf, left he ſhould deprive <hi>Conceit</hi> of his new Chriſtendome, and betray <hi>Pollicy</hi> of his chiefeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but ſtill holding the borrowed habite and artificiall colour of a black <hi>Moor,</hi> he ſtill ſpake unto the <hi>Dolphin</hi> by <hi>Bonfoy</hi> his Interpreter, by whom he diſcourſed of many things: and again, and again, and ſtill again, enquired of ſuch affaires, as moſt neereſt did concern him; wherein he took double delight, in not onely gaining knowledge of the aſſumace of <hi>Viennois life</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> but in deceiving
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59993:75"/>the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> that the <hi>Dolphin</hi> might thereby be the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. In this clouded communication we will leave them a while, to ſee what befell <hi>Mal Fiance,</hi> whom we left detained in the Tavern, ignorant of his Lords ſurpriſe, though not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Ten dayes did the Vintner keep him cloſe, ſtill expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that either the Marchant ſhould return, or that the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zake</hi> ſhould ſend for his reſtrained gueſt. But when he could neither hear of the one, nor the other; he began to grow jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the matter, and premeditating thereon, at laſt, faſtned on this belief; That the Marchant (like a ſubtile <hi>Mercurian</hi>) had cheated the Stranger, and after left him, not onely to pay for the wine, but alſo made him a ſtale to convey himſelf away under the face of honeſty. For otherwiſe he thought, that if there had been cauſe of taxation, complaint, or examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there would no doubt have been haſty inquiſition made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
            <p>In this perſwaſion he ſet <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> at liberty, who now found his repenting errour, in the loſſe of his Lord; Shame rebuk't his tongue, Grief attach'd his heart, and Fear afflicted all his thoughts, at this deer rate he purchas'd wit; which taught him to labour more adviſedly in the fearfull ſearch of the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin;</hi> His enquiring eyes did ſtill pry into every corner of all his carefull and wandring wayes; and in all aſſemblies, he ſought whom he could not find. But when neither weary time, nor wary ſearch could give him any knowledge of him. Then happily meeting with a Flemming, that was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bound for <hi>Zeland,</hi> he went a Shipboard with him, hoping that either he ſhould find his Lord returned to <hi>Viennois,</hi> or give them cauſe to follow him in better queſt.</p>
            <p>After many days ſayling they happily arrived at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> where in an old decayed Burgamaſters houſe, they lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Mal Fiance,</hi> who finding the a ged jealouſie of his aged Hoſt, cunningly carryed himſelf in a ſtrict ſhew of purity; that under that deceit he might the better deceive. This ſuſpitious Syre, having not onely a beautifull daughter, but a young fair
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59993:75"/>wife whom he lately eſpouſed, was ſo fearfully jealous of them both, that he confined them within the limit of his houſe; and if either of them were but out of his ſight, he ſtraight ſuppoſed ſhe was in action; A ſervice which none can digeſt, that may not themſelves perform. But to take away all means that did help (not heal) his miſdeems; he cauſed his daughter to lye in a low bed within his Chamber, and made the door to be lockt each night.</p>
            <p>Now it fell out that there was a great and ſecret love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Daughter; and one <hi>Haunce;</hi> the ſonne of a rich Tanner, that dwelt not farre from him, who by appointment came preſently after ſupper time to her Chamber window, that lookt into the Garden, where he ſo paſſionately pleaded for the Harveſt of his amorous deſires, that ſhe (being made of fleſh, not flint) granted that he ſhould reap the full fruition of his love, if he would but adventure the venture of it. For ſo (ſaid ſhe) it is, that over and beſides my fathers watchfull fear, and ever waking jealouſie, I do lye neer unto him, within his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where though I may eaſily give you entrance, yet to entertain you without his perceivance, ſtands not with my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>That matters not ſaid <hi>Haunce,</hi> I will not leave the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for any adventure; leave the managing thereof to me, who will for thy ſake attempt the height of the hazard. Love fears no danger; and pleaſure without ſhew of perill, looſeth the vigour of her ſweetneſſe: I will with fear ſo deceive his fear. Onely be not thou afraid at any thing that thou ſhalt hear, or ſee, and ſo farewel, and expect my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>All this wanton diſcourſe did <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> liſtning heare, as by chance he leaned in his Chamber window, which was but the breadth of a poſt from her window; who like a true <hi>Venerian</hi> (knowing their carnall concluſion) reſolved to take the benefit of the match, though ſhe were more then his match, and to put into the <hi>Mediterrancan Sea,</hi> when the wind ſhould ſerve, in that pleaſant pinnace, wherein
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59993:76"/>enhaunced <hi>Haunte</hi> hoped ſolely to ſayl with joy through the <hi>Magellan straights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To affect which, he ſate in counſell with all his thoughts, how he might beſt deceive not only hopefull <hi>Haunce,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo her jealous Father, and overamorous mother; who being ſick of old ages tedious, and overlong induring debilityes, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times by her alluring eyes, ſtoln glances, and other enticing dem cancurs, lookt for Phyſick at his hands. At laſt device adviſed him, that there was no way to bind jealouſie to the peace, and to keep himſelf from interruption, but onely by hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of fear, to make him looſe himſelf, and ſenceleſſe of all other fear: In proof whereof, that night, at the dead hour of heavy and leaden ſleep, he took one of his bed-ſheets, and tying a knot on the top, threw it over him, and like a troubled ghoſt, with doubtfull paces went into the Burga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters Chamber; who being kept waking by his decrepit griefs, heard the fall of his ſteps, and being ſo dark that he could not ſee, he gaſtly askt who was there? None but I, ſaid his watching ſenſuall daughter, ſuppoſing it had been <hi>Haunce.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The Daughter whoſe luſtfull attendance, waked after venercall copulation, hearing this, and knowing the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; could not but laugh at her fathers deceiving, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying fear, and in the pride of her naked ſtrength, ſhe prepared her ſelfe (being then moſt ready, when ſhee was moſt unready) both to aſſay and allay that troubleſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> having thus ſecured their ſtirring, by delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their hearing, went boldly to the daughters bed, (the wiſhed port, where he deſired to arrive) where finding no oppoſition; ſhe ſtil deeming him to be <hi>Haunce,</hi> he caſt anchor, that his barque might ride at full Sea: At which time <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> being in conjunction, produced ſuch ſtrange effects, that the bed wherein they lay, did both ſhake and rock; which her mother-in-law hearing, began to be half afraid, having heard nothing before: yet out of wonted holdneſs (which was great in bodily adventures) ſhe called to her daughter and asked her how ſhe did; I do (q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is the better for you, replyed the mother, but do you not heare, nor feel any thing? I hear nothing (ſaid ſhe) that is ill, and moſt aſſured I am; I feel no hurt. Well daughter, ſaid the Mother, bleſſe you, and croſſe you from all evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Nay mother (quoth ſhe) my faith herein hath ever been ſo great, and ſo good, that I neither fear the Devill, nor think any man is preſent that endangers me. All this while the poor Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamaſter lay over the head in the ſweat of his falſe fear, which and ſo tyrantize over his weakneſſe, that he durſtily no longer, but haſtily calling up his man, he had him light a candle: for he would riſe, and go fetch his ghoſtly Father Fryer <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59993:77"/>come to bleſſe his Chamber, and ſprinkle it all over with holy water.</p>
            <p>His wife could not divert him from it, and his daughter and her unknown Paramour were ready to betray themſelves with laughter: yet was <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> glad to hide himſelf in the bed, whilſt to prevent ſuſpition, the daughter roſe, and took upon her to unlock the unlocked doors, by which time the man came with a light, and getting his Maſter up, hee holpe to array him, and after went with a Lanthorne with him to ſeeke the Fryer.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were they gone, but in comes laſcivious <hi>Haunce</hi> in the heat of his deſire, like the Prince of darkneſſe, cloathed in a Bulls-hide, with the horns on his head, (for it much behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to have borns, that muſt leave horns behind him) who finding the doors open, made no ſtay till he came to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters bed, where hearing two breath, he ſoftly ſhrunk back, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it was the Fathers bed, and ſtumbling after by hap on the other bed, where the wife lay all alone, he holding down his head ſoftly ſaid; Fear not my Love, it is I, and ſo diſmantling himſelf, laid him down by her, who conceiting that it was <hi>Mal Fiance,</hi> that had taken the benefit of her husbands going forth, reſiſted not, but entertained him with all the full favours, that wanton love could afford: (Thus doe Womens light thoughts many times make their husbands to have heavie heads.)</p>
            <p>But in this amorous combat, the very bed proclaimed their forceable encounters, and the fall of bedſtaves well witneſſed their freſh aſſaults, which the daughter hearing, deemed that her reſtleſſe mother was tormented with ſome terrour of fear: and therefore calling to her, ſhe wiſhed her to have a good litart, and not to yeeld to idle conceits, which but troubled the mind with deceiving imaginations. The mother perceiving that ſomething was perceived, and that they were heard, took upon her to be affrighted, and ſaid: Alas daughter, ſomething, I know, hath been upon me, and if ſpirits have any ſubſtances, it is ſurely one. Cover your ſelf well, ſaid the daughter.</p>
            <p>By this enterchange of chatte, <hi>Haunce</hi> knew that he had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59993:77"/>travailed in a by-path, which ſo diſtaſted him, that his teeth gnaſhed together for anger, and <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> lay loughing at the knowledge thereof, who remembring now, that <hi>Haunce</hi> would come in ſome fearfull ſhape, to make way for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he thought to work further on him, and to beat him with his own weapon; And to give life to his device, he ſtole up, and creeping along the beds ſide, wherein euchaffed <hi>Haunce</hi> did<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly he ſought by feeling, and by feeling ſound the hairy hide, which by handling thereof, he knew well was a garment of his Fathers, and as he threw it over him, with intent to frighten <hi>Haunce,</hi> he heard his Hoſt and the Frier coming into the houſe; who came ſooner then they were expected: Then he was forc'd to run behind the door, thinking by his hell-like habite, to terrifie them all; and ſo got unknown to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Haunce</hi> perceiving light through the door (for as yet the Fryer durſt not come in, till he had ſaid divers <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> and beſprinkled the door with his holy water ſprinkle) leap'd haſtily out of his diſliked bed, and failing to find his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills coat, he pul'd the higher ſheet out of the bed, and ſhrowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf therein, went like a ghoſt to the other ſide of the dore, thinking likewiſe ſo ſuddenly to fright them, that undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered he might eſcape. But the tardy-taken-women, that now were more afraid of ſhame, then they were before of ſin, were driven to ſuch an exigent, that they knew not how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, neither rebuke not reproach: their ſcarlet bluſhes accuſed them, and the holy Church was at the dore ready to condemn them.</p>
            <p>In this hell they lay, fearing to bee ſeene, untill the light which moſt they feared, freed them from thoſe they moſt feared. For the new transformed Devill, and the late meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed ghoſt, ſuddainly ſeeing each other by the light of the Candle, upon the opening of the dore, were ſo agaſt at the fearefull ſight of either others terrifying, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne ſhapes, that they verily thought, that the Devill, or ſome other ill ſpirit were purpoſely come from hell to carry them away, for their ſinfull aſſuming their damned
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59993:78"/>formes to ſuch wicked and forbidden ends. In this fear and fearful thought, they made ſuch haſt to run away the one from the other, that they both ruſht at once ſo forceably through the door, that they bear the old Burgamaſter down, and turned the poor Fryer over and over; in which fall he pittifully brake his face on the houſecill, and half drowned the Burga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter with the Holy-water that he brought and ſhed upon him.</p>
            <p>The carefull women though they were thus cleared of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, yet were they ſo danted at the ſight of theſe incarnall devills, that they wofully cryed, and ſhrieked out; the ſervant with the Lanthorn as one diſtract; run out of doors; <hi>Mal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> as fearfully fled to his chamber; and heartleſs <hi>Haunce</hi> moſt amazedly run into the ſtreet after the ſervant; who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for fear behind him, ſaw this ſpirit P. running (as he thought) after him; which made him cry out, help, help, a ſpirit, a ghoſt; a ghoſt, a ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The Watchmen comming, and hearing him, thought the man was ſtark mad; but looking about, they ſaw this affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted frightning ghoſt comming towards them, which put them all into ſuch amazed fear, that they threw down their weapons and run away. The coaſt being thus cleared, unhappy <hi>Haunce</hi> got into his Fathers houſe.</p>
            <p>But now the next neighbours that had heard the wretched womans ſhrieking cries, were riſen, and having gotten lights ſpeedily came to ſee, and know the cauſe of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes, And finding the Maſter of the houſe and the Fryer (whom fear had entranced) half dead on the floor, and the Frier all bloudied by his fall, they ſuppoſing, that they were ſlain, inſtantly cried out, Murther, murther; The diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed women (that all this while lay over their heads, in the bath of their ſweating feare, doing pennance for their ſtolne pleaſures) having their fear both renewed, and redoubled by theſe their cries; cryed out as faſt, the Devill, the Devill, at the hearing whereof, all the neighbours runne out of the houſe again, and <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> grew upon this dreadfull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanim, ſo fearfully timerous, that hee durſt not moove
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59993:78"/>though he were more then moved. In this agony of terrour, did they all lye till break of day, when light (the comfort of dark diſmay) emboldned the chief Officer (who of purpoſe was ſent for) to enter into this houſe of horrour, where raiſing them from the place of purgatory; they found upon examination that the devill had been there, and was the cauſe of all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> who now had made peace with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted thoughts; not onely found his own error, but eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the ſhift, and enforced ſubtilty of the other. For remembring he had disfurniſhed <hi>Haunce</hi> of his black Mantle, and ſo prevented him of his infernal ſhape, he conceited that he had no other means to free himſelf, then by taking one of the ſheets, and ſo by appearing like a ghoſt to make way for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In the belief of this conceit, he vowed that <hi>Haunce</hi> ſhould wel pay both for terrifying him, and for his planting in anothers Vineyard.</p>
            <p>And to this end, he ſeeking found him, and told him, that he had a very good Bulls hide to ſell him. <hi>Haunce</hi> knowing well where he lay was much aſtoniſht thereat, and thanking him ſaid, he had no need of any. Then (quoth <hi>Mal Fiance</hi>) ſhall my Hoſt have it to make him a Night-gown; but you ſhall pay for the horns, though you were ſo liberall, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give them. For in brief Mr. Tanner, the abuſe that you have offered mine Hoſt, and the ſcandall that you have raiſed on his houſe is ſo injuriouſly great, and ſo ſhamefully injurious, that unleſſe you will give me ten pounds, I will uneaſe the Devill, and both reveal his adulterous dealing, and tell of your ghoſtly eſcape <hi>Haunce</hi> ſeeing he was diſcovered bought his concealment with his coin: which made <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that being ſo well ſilver-ſhod for travell he diſcharged all his debts, and in the innocency of his thought, not dreaming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any danger, he made more haſt then good ſpeed to <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois.</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59993:79"/>to anſwer thereunto, was preſently deemed, either to have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him, or to have betrayed him to his enemies: For it is a rule by obſervation true: that they that fear not to be thought faulty, will neither be afraid to commit the fault, nor aſhamed to be ſeen after the fact. His leaving (howſoever) of his Liege Lord, was held worthy of death. And therefore was he ſent bound hand and foot to priſon, till rigour of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould by ſpeedy ſentence award him condigne punniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But the bruit hereof begat ſuch tumultuous uproares, and brought forth ſuch miſchievous factions both in Court and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that hardly could the tempeſt be allayed without the utter ſubverſion of the State. For how ſhould the low ſhrubs ſtand in rebellion, when the high Cedar was thought to be blown down by treaſon? In this combuſtion, ſome ſtood for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitate heir the Princeſſe <hi>Vieuna,</hi> whoſe liberty they proudly required amongſt whom, Sir <hi>Iaques,</hi> and <hi>La-nova</hi> were moſt forward.</p>
            <p>Some for the malicious ano proud <hi>Dolphinis,</hi> whoſe Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy many affected; but all malecontents, repugnant, humoriſts, diſordered men decaied perſons, &amp; ſervile Peaſants (that thrive beſt in mutation of States, and live by others falling, as ſwine do by the dropping of Acorns) flocked about <hi>Monſieur Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne,</hi> the reputed baſtard of the <hi>Delphin,</hi> who ambitiouſly would needs (according to the wicked diſpoſition of illegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates) deprive others by ruin and rapine of their rights, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to himſelf the Crown.</p>
            <p>The fired factions began to break out into flaming ſedition and masked Rebellion wayted but on time and advantage, to uſe open force againſt each other; The Common-Weale did well to ſee her deſtruction in this triumviry; Among theſe bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and brambles; that ſought to over-top the ſtately Oak; awfull Juſtice had no powerfull place: Law was of no force, and authority loſt all command. For where alteration threatens Warre, there the ſword maketh all things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>But when the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance.</hi> who was an <hi>Anthony</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59993:79"/>in clemency, a <hi>Trajan</hi> in bounty, and another <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in wiſdom, beloved of moſt and reſpected of all; ſaw this triper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and diſſentious diviſion growing to ſuch monſtious heads: and hearing that many of the giddy-headed multitude were already aſsembled together in the Market place in a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner according to the mutinous natures of the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commons, fearing their aptneſs to innovation, and the ſad effects of civill broyls, or ſome ſudden overture, leaving (becauſe wanting) all time of further conſideration: even in the aſsurance of his vertue, and ſtrength of his zeal to his Country, he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to the Market-place, where all men (notwithſtanding their diſtemperatures) gave way to his merit, and in love fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after him.</p>
            <p>So powerfull was he in popular affection, which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſtayed; and turning himſelf towards them, with tears in his eyes and his Hat in his hands, more like an humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, then a regall Ruler, he made a ſign for audience; which granted, he mildly after ſome few ſighs ſaid,</p>
            <p>What moves my faſt friends, loving favourites, and more then dear Counntry-men, to this threatning mutiny? What di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs your quiet peace, or what ſeek you by the hurtfull Arms? Do you want a Prince? Why the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> your liege Lord (for ought any knows) liveth, and the Princeſs his apparent Heir is not dead.</p>
            <p>Doth any uſurp your rights, or oppreſs you with wrongs? Why Juſtice ſhall give to every one his own, and I am here ready to ſhed my bloud in your behalfs. Or doth the bare ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of your Soveraigns death, thus untimely move you to create, and inveſt a new, becauſe <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> is returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Lord? A project, truſt me, that will bring forth ſome notable deceitfull deſign.</p>
            <p>If needs he muſt be dead, becauſe none can hear tell that he is alive; Why then ſhould he not be as well living, becauſe here no one knows that he is dead? But admit, that our ſins have (which God forbid) deprived us of him, doth it follow, that the ambitious <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s, or that degenerat
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59993:80"/>Baſtard <hi>Maligne,</hi> ſhould ſucceed him? What though <hi>Vienua</hi> be a priſoner to her Fathers will, and my faith muſt keep her ſtill a thrall to his ſeverity? yet the Father dying, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters bonds are broken, I diſcharged, and you tyed, to inthronize her for your lawfull Princeſs.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould there be any ſuch diſparity of minds, or diverſity of affections amongſt you, ſince you are all ſubjects born to one end, and <hi>Viennonians</hi> ſworn to one right? What ſhall become of this Principality, when thoſe that ſhould u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themſelves to maintain the Weal-publique; do thus divide themſelves, to overthrow the Publique-Weal? Know you not, that by thus banding your ſelves, you do altogether aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your ſelves?</p>
            <p>Will not your inſulting, and incroaching Neighbours (the proud <hi>Savonians</hi>) our inveterate and irreconciliable enemies, take advantage of your weakning of your own ſtrengths, enter forcibly upon your rights, diſpoſſeſſe you of your Habitations, and make you Aliens to your Inheritances? Yes, yes, be you aſſured, that hatred amongſt friends, gives ever ſuccour to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and that Civill Wars within you, will bring Forraign Wars upon you.</p>
            <p>Look on the <hi>Dolphinis,</hi> of whom I am loath to ſpeak ill, yet in this, I know not how to ſpeak well. Doth not her unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted corruption, and pride ſhow, that ſhe loves a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>llace better then her Paradiſe? that thinks by ſhamefull rebellion, to make her ſelf a ſinfull Queen?</p>
            <p>Know you not, that they that are ſo greedy, ſo unlawfully to get, will be ever as ready to do wrong? What colour of claim can ſhe have, that is neither royalized by propagation, nor extract from Princely or Noble bloud? She had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given her in his Highneſs rule; nor hath ſhe any left her at his departure.</p>
            <p>It is, I ſee, only her pride, that can ſuffer no equall; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignes</hi> ambition, that can brook no Superiour: two Fire-brands that burnt up <hi>Romes</hi> moſt glorious Monarchy O let them both then fall in their pride, that ſeek ſo unjuſtly to fly, before they have wings; and waſh not your eyes, and hands, like <hi>Envy</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59993:80"/>in one anothers fall. In perſiſting to maintain evill, <hi>Maligno</hi> doth condemn himſelf; otherwiſe, he would not ſeek to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that with bloud and ſhame, which he can neither get, nor keep, without ſinne and death. In all the Scriptures, there was but one ſole Baſtard (only <hi>Jephtha</hi>) that did come to any good; and yet he had the mark of the Curſe: for his all-onely Daughter was moſt ſorrowfully ſacrificed for her great Fathers offence; And this was but to ſhew, that there is no perpetuity, nor long proſperity, in hatefull and condemned baſtardy. And will you then make the corrupt and curſed ſeed, and excrement of ſinne, your unlawfull Prince? that by all divine, nature, and nationall Laws, hath no inheritance on Earth, and whom the Jews counted as no part of their Congregation.</p>
            <p>If the Father be an Adulterer, and the Mother a Fornicator, the Son muſt in reaſon be a bad liver, and a wicked Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>For he that is born in double ſinne, muſt of likelyhood in nature, be both ſubject to many faults, and guilty of many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. And how can polluted hands make foul Veſſels clean? or how can he that is but the Son of the People, be the Son of the <hi>Dolphin?</hi> The Mothers acknowledgment, and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is no proof; that ever fathers them on thoſe that can beſt maintain them. She cannot be true to one, that is untrue to her ſelf; Corruption will ſtill break out there, where it is once feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, How then can you affect the Son of ſhame, or without ſhame, yield your ſelves ſubject to the Son of a ſtrumpet? If his deſire be beyond his merit and reach, let him fall beſides his hopes, and receive juſt guerdon for his deſerts.</p>
            <p>As for the vertuous Princeſs, whoſe right I reverence, and whoſe worth I admire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let her yet remain (though with better reſpect) where ſhe is,</p>
            <p>For it is not good over-ſuddainly to open a wound, that hath bin long cloſed up.</p>
            <p>The greateſt right, may do the moſt wrong, and the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good action, is no ſinne; when it cannot be done without committing of ſinne. I have ſworn to her Father, and would be found faithfull to my Lord; I affect not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59993:81"/>For in this, I am but like the Sun that carryes his Lan horn for others, and not for himſelf. It is better to be doubtfull, then over-credulous; and the uncertainty of his death is no warrant for my diſcharge, nor your diſobedience. There is time for all things, and the <hi>Moon</hi> that is not yet riſen, may riſe, and ſhine in full glory, though now ſhe be eclipſed. What more would you have, or what further (O you fond <hi>Vienno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>) do you endeavour to affect? Will you turn Traytors to your Lord, rip up your own bowels, make your wives wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and your children fatherleſs, and helpleſs? Will you put fire to your own houſes, poſſeſs your foes with your wives, and wealths, ſee your daughters deflowred, and make an utter devaſtation of your Country?</p>
            <p>Alaſs! I ſee your wilfulneſs betrayes your wits, and draws on your overthrows into your Enemies tryumphs; and grief makes me to ſhed tears of bloud for your own purchaſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
            <p>Let me at laſt, O let me in love, and tender care of your welfares, dehort you from wounding of your ſelves, and leave theſe ill preſaging jars amongſt you; and like birds of one flock fly together: Maintain your ſacred Oaths, for preſervation of your Soveraigns right, till better aſſurance acquit you from your obliged faiths. To haſten the knowledge whereof, I will wing many Meſsengers with ſpeed, to enquire, and learn what is become of our Soveraign Lord; with that the tears did trickle down his face, which ſtruck ſuch a compaſſionate regard in all their hearts, that being before made ſenſitive of their errours, and now fully ſatisfied, and reclaimed by his tongue of perſwaſion, they joyfully threw up their Hats, and ſome lifting him up, cryed, God ſave the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> under whoſe Government we will only live.</p>
            <p>Thus did his pleaſing words, powerfull authority, mild be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, refined and probable reaſons and ſubtilized diſtinction allay the force of he approaching ſtorm, and gave ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to all, that every one departing in love, brought home peace to their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59993:81"/>
Thus did this noble Governour (like a good and skilfull Muſicianer put all this jarring diſcord, in a good and true tune; which ſo croſt the hatefull hopes of malicious <hi>Maligne,</hi> that failing of native ſtrength and rebellious forces; to dignifie his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities; he ſuddenly fled unto the Savoy Duke, to require forraign aid to royallize his proud baſeneſſe. Such was his aſpiring wrath, that it had no mean, and ſuch his Treaſon that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad no end.</p>
            <p>Fear now made him doubt the rigour of law, that before would have been ſubject to no law: and therefore did he in ſuch unſtable waters, and threatning winds, ſeeke for more powerfull eares; which the ſubtile Duke well perceiving, thought to feed on him, as <hi>Pharohs</hi> leane Kine did on the fat.</p>
            <p>But before he went, he adviſed thereof with his politick and ſworn confederate friend, <hi>Monſieur Meſchant,</hi> whoſe falſe ſemblable minds, ever made ſuch a full connexion of wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, as what the one perniciouſly contrived, the other moſt traiterouſly put in practiſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Moſchant</hi> ſeeing him already over the ſhooes in danger, perſwaded him to wade up to the chin: For, ſaid he, there can never be any perill in the adventure, where the Foord promiſeth ſo good a paſſage. Danger now only dwels at home, and the Savoy Duke may both fortifie your hope, and raiſe your fortunes. Offer him but intereſt in the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and you ſhall find that his avarice and pride, will in that hope greedily work on our broken and diſturbed ſtate. So then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily with ſpeed, and moſt powerfully and ſucceſſively; may you return; and as prevailent may your ſucceſſe be, as your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is moſt pertinent. And therewithal, he took a ſheet of clean paper, and laying both ſides ſtraight together, he cut di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rowes through them both; and after cutting them a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he kept the one halfe himſelf, and gave the other, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
            <p>By this, and through this, ſhall you (without either dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me, or perceivance of any other) ſtill know what is here done, and what I would have you further to do. For
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59993:82"/>though I writ my Letters directly, and moſt diſtaſtfully againſt your Apoſtacy, and combination with the publique foe, and adviſe you to betray that noble Duke, (which for ſafety I muſt ſtill do, leſt in the portage or otherwiſe, my Letters ſhould miſcarry) yet ſhall you at all times unmask my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended intelligence, and find out both my fallacy, and true inſtructions, if you but take this your cut pattern, and lay it on my Letter, where you ſhall plainly, and formally read through the ſame, no more, then what I purpoſely in truth do write unto you, and would willingly enfeoffe you with. In like manner (as I will teach you) may you ſafely by the ſame illuſion, certifie me of all your projects and deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maligne</hi> thanked him, prayed his remembrance thereof, and ſo bad him farewell. For fear ſent him poſt away, and hope gave him ſuch ſpeed, and in ſhort time he came to the Dukes Court, where after he had moſt reſpectively ſaluted him he related how that the <hi>Dophin</hi> his father was dead, and that the L. <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> affecting government, moſt ambitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought to retain his uſurped rule.</p>
            <p>That the Princeſſe <hi>Vienna</hi> was in priſon unregarded o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all; and that he had himſelf many ſtrong and aſſured favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, that would ſtand for his fortune. In furtherance whereof he was come to pray his aſſiſtance, and for guerdon thereof, he would intereſt him in that half of <hi>Dolphin,</hi> thet lay next unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus did he ſeek his own ruine with great labour, and buy repentance with bloudy coſt. Thus did he make himſelf a bridg for the incroaching Duke to enter upon his Country: and this gap did he open that the <hi>Savonian</hi> forces might like an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dationſubmerg and overwhelm both himſelf, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the State,</p>
            <p>For the Duke, who ever wayted on opportunity, and ſtill watched how the Market went, finding now the Mine diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; he thought good to make profit thereof, and to take the benefit of the Tide, while the floud ſerved. And therefore he embraced the perſon, for the occaſion, and premiſing

The opinion of poſſibility ſo redoubled his unbounded deſires, that he thought that time too long; that he ſpent in going. But it had been better for him with the <hi>Tertoiſe,</hi> to have kept his head within his own ſhell, then by ſeeking ſo abroad to raiſe his fortunes out of anothers ruines.</p>
            <p>For that carefull Shepheard, the ever watchfull Governour) being now ſummoned by waſtfull Warre, to defend both his Flock and his Fold, ſtood not like a doubtfull Chyrurgion, to conſult of the ripeneſſe of the ſore; but like an expert Captain (that at the firſt) would prevent fury by force) he ſuddenly raiſed 3000. men, whom in pride of his aged age he himſelf led into <hi>Dolphin</hi> to encounter with the injurious and intruding Duke.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Meſcant</hi> hearing that the Duke and <hi>Maligne,</hi> were entred into <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and ſeeing the preſent preparation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty march that the governour now made againſt them; He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly writ unto <hi>Maligne</hi> thereof, and thus deceitfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed his ſubtile intelligences.</p>

            <p>Thus in a fair cup of gold did this peſtiferous <hi>Meſchant</hi> utter his hidden poyſon; And under the apparent ſhew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt loyalty, did he give both treacherous intelligence, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous inſtructions to the hoſtile enemy. For <hi>Maligne</hi> upon the receit of this Letter, laid his patern thereon, and ſo read his ſubtil and cloked advertiſements through the ſame, as by laying down, and covering this his Letter, with this exampled pattern, you may plainly perceive.</p>
            <p>By this time had the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and Sir <hi>Sirap</hi> (after teadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous travail) recovered <hi>Marcolles</hi> in <hi>Prevince,</hi> through
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59993:83"/>which they paſt unknown into <hi>Dolphin;</hi> where the <hi>Dolphin</hi> finding his Country, in his declining days, covered over with Campes, Carriages, barbed Horſes, and armed Souldiers; he amazedly asked, and asking learned, the unexpected cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which made him beway his ſiniſter fortunes, and envy no little againſt that impious abject, his accuſſed ſuppoſed Sonne. Grief now made him weep at his Countries calamity, and fear made him doubt his own deprivation. The Harveſt of his ſins, yielded him now more increaſe of woes; then the luſts of his youth afforded him pleaſures. But how ſhould (ſaid the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull <hi>Dolphin</hi>) he that is begotten in my full ſin, and born in his own ſhame; live without doing villany, or dy without making miſchief? If his being be from me, why then ſhould he ſeek to take from me my being?</p>
            <p>And if he be none of mine, what then hath he to do with it, which is mine? but he is not mine, but the Son of iniquity, and ſcorn of nature; and therefore knows neither his ſhameleſs ſelf, nor his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>full father.</p>
            <p>I nouriſhed him (as a Snake) in the boſome of my love, and now he would ſting me to death, in the poyſon of his hate.</p>
            <p>O how juſt are the judgments of God, that pays our amiſs, in the amiſs of our offences, and makes our wicked pleaſures our juſt puniſhments!</p>
            <p>In this bemoaning fury, did he call for vengeance to be powred down on <hi>Maligne;</hi> which <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeeing, could not but grieve at his ſad lamentations, though otherwiſe he rejoyced, that occaſion preſented unto him both a means to ſhew there his proweſs; and a way to make his Country indebted to his valour. For (as a ſtranger) he knew he ſhould win honour, and after gain (being made known) more reſpect. The wruth of War he did not fear, nor made he any doubt of his Countries ſafety.</p>
            <p>And therefore he chearfully commanded <hi>Boufoy</hi> to comfort the diſtreſſed <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and to aſsure him, that the God of the <hi>Viennoians</hi> had brought him thither, in juſtice, both to puniſh the treachery of his degenerate Son; and alſo to correct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59993:84"/>pride of the intruding Duke; in both whoſe ambitious blouds, he vowed to bath his revengefull Sword, and by force of the <hi>Viennontan</hi> forces, to overthrow all the <hi>Savonians,</hi> Only entreat him to take up the heat of his indignation in the embers, and to keep himſelf unknown that thereby he might receive a true try all of his ſubjects forces, and fidelities; and the eaſier eſcape, and ſupport himſelf after, with forraign ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, if the <hi>Viennonians</hi> ſhould unhappily bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht.</p>
            <p>As for himſelf, he would (when they were hotteſt in battell) ſuddenly thruſt himſelf amongſt them, where he would write ſuch Tragedles in his enemies blood, that weeping repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould teach them, what it is, to invade anothers right, and to diſplant the true Vine. His Highneſſe and <hi>Bonfoy,</hi> I would have them like two peaceable Pilgrims, to ſtand ſafely aloof, and to view the hazard of the game, till the laſt chance be caſt, and then ſecretly to convey themſelves to ſome cave in the near adjoyning Wood, whither in the darke of night I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcryed repaire, and further conſult what after will bee done.</p>
            <p>To this the animated <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſubſcribed. For in his vertuous valour, and practive knowledge did he build his new raiſed hope; and on his unreſiſtable force, and moſt fortunate a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did his comfort depend.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sirap</hi> having about him his never failing Semitar, wherewith he vanquiſht <hi>Turbuleut the fierce,</hi> and being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the Shield, and armour, that he forceably took from the Captaine of the Pyrats in the <hi>Affrick</hi> Seas; he made all things in readineſſe, and inſtantly ſent <hi>Bonſoy</hi> to the next Town with his Shield, to cauſe a Painter to draw on it a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed waved Sea, and in the middeſt thereof a crowned <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> driving other Fiſhes before him, and ſtriking many under the waves with his tayl, with this Impreſſe under. <hi>Crowned to Conquer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the <hi>Dolphins</hi> unknowne Knight, in honour of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> make himſelf the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin.</hi> But by this time the two Armies, marching both on, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59993:84"/>each other in ſight, which made the <hi>Savoy</hi> Duke to make a ſtand, and to ſet his men in good array of battell, which he divided into two parts. The firſt were his troops of Horſe, which he aſſigned to be conducted by the Baſtard <hi>Maligne.</hi> The other, conſiſting of Foot, he led himſelf.</p>
            <p>In this equipage he ſoberly marcht, till he came to a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Plain, neer to <hi>Andre,</hi> where he preparedly ſtay'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on of the <hi>Viennonians,</hi> who being well marſhelled in one mean Battell, Creſsat-wiſe, with two wings of Horſe on either ſide, came on apace, by the Command of their good Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance;</hi> unto whom, honour gave ſpurs; his place, faithfulneſs; and the love of his Country, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maligne</hi> hearthed on the Duke with the falſe aſſurance of the <hi>Viennonians</hi> revolt, and the hope to incorporate that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality to his own, haled him on the more to that bloudy bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. For the charge being given, Deſire and Revenge encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred each other with ſuch fury, that the Battell was long in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, Victory inclining to neither ſide, till at laſt, the Troop of the <hi>Savonian</hi> Horſes diſranked both the Wings of the <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonians,</hi> and brake in upon the Squadron of the Foot, with ſuch violence, that they began to ſtaggerand give back. When the all-valorous, and invincible <hi>Sirap,</hi> the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> came fortunatly in, who finding where danger dwelled moſt, there he oppoſed himſelf, and like to a ſuddain Tempeſt, bare down all before him. His deſire to approve himſelf in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries defence, and his implacable wrath againſt thoſe, that ſought to defeat <hi>Vienna</hi> of her right, and to defraud him of the comfort of his hope, made his blows fall like thunder, and his ſword to cut like the Executioners Ax.</p>
            <p>None could ſtand before him, nor durſt there any come neer him; which ſo encouraged the diſheartned remainder of the <hi>Viennonian</hi> Cavality, that they ranked themſelves again, and came up to ſecond him.</p>
            <p>This freſh, and new aſsault, diſordered and diſmayed the <hi>Savonian</hi> troops, who now fought fearfully and confuſedly;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59993:85"/>which <hi>Maligne</hi> perceiving, purpoſely, and fatally brought up all his forces, and begirt him round, thinking ſo to end the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell by making ann end of him, that both had ended ſo many of their lives, and onely maintained the battell. In this danger, did the undanted Knight of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> fight ſo long, that his horſe was ſlain under him, which he with great agillity wel and quickly avoyded, and being on foot, perceived his other ſelf; his entire deer friend <hi>La-nova</hi> (whom he knew by his coat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armor) to lye in the duſt.</p>
            <p>This ſight was ſuch an alarum to waken revenge, that he grew now more ſuriouſly wrathfull, and more irefully impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then before, and being deſirous to recover his body, he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ſtrid over him, and like valiant <hi>Hector</hi> amidſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> he ſtood to withſtand all aſſaylers. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova</hi> being thus freed from the ſmothering feet of his enemies, having had time of breathing, came to himſelf (for he was not mortally wounded) and began to ſtirre, which being found and perceived by the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> (maugre all the force of his ſwarming and preſſing foes, hee tooke him up, and bare him to the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> unto whom, kiſſing him of in manifeſtation of his love, he delivered him with many ſpeaking ſignes, that he ſhould be ſent ſafely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>The Generall who had ſeen with the eyes of admiration, the incomprehenſible force, and unvaluable valour of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Knight, reſpectively received him, and accordingly ſent him to the next Town, and then having already brought up his ſtrength of foot, of purpoſe to ſuccour the <hi>Dolphin</hi>-Knight, he followed him in his bloudy paſſage, with intent to horſe him again, leſt he ſhould miſcarry in that perill: In this deſire, he came on ſo furiouſly faſt, that the Savoy Duke, ſeeing the rage of this tempeſtuous floud, to over-bear <hi>Malignes</hi> forces, advanced his main battell, and like a terrible ſtorm, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Viennonians.</hi> But this lightning laſted not long, for the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> perceiving that now the dice was caſt, and that they both were to avoid their laſt chance, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all his ſtrength together, and in the vigour of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59993:85"/>courage, meeting with <hi>Maligne,</hi> he ſmote him ſo on his Burganet, that he fell'd him ſore wounded to the earth, where being no reſpite for reſeue, he was ſmothered, and troden to death.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus dy'd the ſpaws of ſin, in ſinfull ſhame,</l>

            <p>Now notwithſtanding, the withſtanding <hi>Savonians,</hi> the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> took <hi>Malignes</hi> Horſe, and in deſpite of all interruption, he lightly mounted on him, and with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding ſword he made ſuch a ſlaughter, that he found little reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>This remarkable act, gave not only freſh hope, but new life to <hi>Eſperance,</hi> who wondred not ſo much at who he was, as at what he did, and yet he thought he muſt be more then a man, that did more then a man could doe. But the doubtfull <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſtanding all this while aloof, joyfully beholding the heroicall deeds of his ſecond Saviour, ſaid to <hi>Bonfoy,</hi> that <hi>Siraps</hi> valour was beyond all apprehenſion, his courage above all conceit, his puiſſance more then humane, and his deeds ſurmounting all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
            <p>By him, ſaid he, I have my ſecond being; and by him I ſee, I ſhall be ſtill a Prince; O would, and as he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further, he made a ſtay to behold the diſtempered Duke, who ſeeing his men diſcomfited and ſlain, moſt by this alone Knight, came in with a troop of reſerve, whom he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to unite all their forces together, and bend themſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the taking or killing of this unknown <hi>Hercules,</hi> the moſt redoubted Knight of the <hi>Dolphin;</hi> but coſtly experience made them loath to come ſo near him, as to hurt him, leaſt breaking the rule of pitty, they ſhould be guilty of their owne deaths.</p>
            <p>Yet in ſome preſumption both of their number and Armour, they faintly aſſaulted him to their repenting detriments.</p>
            <p>In this freſh conflict the Knight of the <hi>Dolphins</hi> Beaver was broken, and fell downe, which much more advantaged
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59993:86"/>then endammaged, or endangered him. For the Enemies ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his black hew, and his wrathfull eyes (being then kindled a new with anger) ſhining like fire, were ſuddainly appaled with ſuch dread and fearfull amazement, that (holding him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an infernall ſpirit, then a mortall man) they began to recoil and to fly from him like a great Covy of frighted Partridges, from the firſt purſuit of a fierce Faulcon; whereupon he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed his Conquering ſword, and cried out in Greek, Victory, Victory, and then followed them with ſuch raging fury, that he hewed out his way in blood, till he encountred that proud invading Duke, whom he knew by his rich Armour, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king now to make an end of both him and the battel at once, he lifted up his controuling and quelling arm, and ſo enragedly ſmote him on the ſide of his helmet, that neither the ſteel, nor the temper, could ſecure him from that fatal and inevitable blow but as all men fall, that ſeek to build their fortunes upon others ruines; ſo fell he now (in the height of his hope) breathleſſe to to the ground. Then began the <hi>Savonians</hi> to fly on all hands, and light unharneſſed legs were better then wel approved arms. Moſt of them were ſlain, few eſcaped, the reſt were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,</p>
            <p>Night drawing on the Generall, the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> commanded to ſound the Retrait.

But after his full heart had a little enjoyed it ſelf, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what digeſted his ſurfeit of joy. Then, then, his tongue was enabled to applaud his victory; and he both crowned his proweſſe with loud reſounding praiſes, and gave him more then many thanks for his moſt glorious and happy labours; And now with more regard, did he not onely induſtriate himſelf to do him all the kind Offices of love, but alſo humbly offered to unarm him, which in no wiſe <hi>Sirap</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but wearied with that dayes travell, he betook himſelf to his reſt; where his reſtleſſe thoughts began a new Warre betwixt his deſire and determination: fain would he haue ſeen her, whom he loved more then his life, and yet to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate well on things profitable, he held to be a moſt provident delay.</p>
            <p>At laſt he reſolved to keep himſelf, and them unknown for ſome few dayes, that the Country might be ſetled in peace, and he ſee what courſe would be hold both for <hi>Vienna</hi> and for the government. In the interim he might the better conclude with himſelf about his own affairs. O noble, noble <hi>Paris,</hi> more noble then thoſe that are enabled with flattering, and fading titles. How loving art thou true? How truly wiſe, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that not onely canſt without pride conquer thy foes; but alſo without folly (beyond nature) command to own and deereſt affections,</p>
            <p>If that wanton <hi>Trojan</hi> had had the like ſympathy of mind and the ſame ſtable fincerity of heart, as he had the likeneſs and unity of thy name, <hi>Troy</hi> had been unconquered, and he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved longer, &amp; in greater glory. But let us return to the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> who after the overthrow and ejectment of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonians,</hi> had poſting news brought him, that the malicious and imperious <hi>Dolphinis,</hi> upon notice of the victory, fell ſuddenly dead. She could live no longer, that had no hope to rule any longer; Her pride and Soveraignty could neither brook ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor endure controlement; Beſides the guilt of her own evil, proclaimed her death; and the fear of looſing her life, was the loſſe of her life.</p>
            <p>Such is the nature of greatneſſe, that but croſt in their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59993:87"/>courſes, they ſhrink under the weight of their owne burthenous pride.</p>
            <p>But her remove, moved not ſo much the good Governor, as the miſſe of their glorious preſerver, that invincible &amp; all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Knight of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> that to their amazement had ſo oft relieved their weakned forces, reſcued their fainting endangered friends, repuls'd their oppreſſing enemies, ſlain moſt of their beſt Corumanders, danted the whole army, and at two blows, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and killed the Malignant <hi>Maligne,</hi> and the proud am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Duke, that potent Generall.</p>
            <p>Then he cauſed inquiſition to be made throughout all his Territories after him, and rich rewards promiſed to him, that could or ſhould give knowledge of him: but no one could ſhew what he was or where he was: only ſome declared, that his Beaver being broken in battell, they ſaw his ſace as black as darkneſſe, and his eyes as bright as fire; which made the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour doubtfull whether he were a man, that did more then many men; or no man that could not be ſubdued by an hoaſt of men; or that the all-mercifull God in fayour of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed right, had fent ſome of his correcting Miniſters, to chaſton, and powre vengeance on the hatefull heads of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſoes.</p>
            <p>But the War being thus ended, peace called a councell for the further eſtabliſhing of tranquillity; And the conſideration of theſe bloody jars cordemned poor <hi>Mal-Firance</hi> to dy, not only for leaving his Lord, and being unable to give an account of his Soveraigns life; but alſo for being the firſt cauſe of pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon in the State, and after of forraign invaſion.</p>
            <p>The loſs of ſo many of their lives, made them all thirſt after his; To haſten which, they brought him the next day to the place of execution, where happily the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and <hi>Sirap,</hi> with his man <hi>Bonfoy,</hi> came by all in Pilgrims gownes, as they were (by agreement) going to the City; who ſeeing and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cauſe of that Aſſembly, withdrew themſelves, and upon ſhort conſideration, they ſent <hi>Bonſoy</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (who needs would be there to hear his lateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) that he might learn ſomewhat concerning his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59993:87"/>Lord. Of him did <hi>Bonfoy,</hi> (knowing now the cauſe) in the name of his Maſter, the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> require that <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> ſhould be delivered unto him; which gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he would undertake to bring them to the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In aſſurance whereof, he (unfolding his Gown) tendered the honor of his Maſters ſhield, as a pledge for his performance which when the Lord <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> ſaw, he knew it by the deviſe thereon, to be the ſame, that the Knight of the <hi>Doiphin</hi> carried in btatell, and therefore he joyfully took it, and kiſting it reverently, ſaid; That that remarkable badge of his? all-vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and moſt glorious worth, (beſides the glad tidings he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of their gracious Lord) was more then ſufficient, to redeem a world of lives; And therefore preſenting <hi>Mal Piance</hi> unto him, he prayed that they might both ſee the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and the <hi>Dolphin</hi> Knight, whom next to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> both he, and all the <hi>Viennonians,</hi> did, and would ever honour, as their ſole and only preſerving Patron; And then taking his Chain from about his neck, he gave it him, ſaying: Let this be a witnes of my grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulnos, and truly tel thee with what true joy I entertain, thy wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tydings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonfoy</hi> humbly thanked his honour, and requeſted him, that he would be pleaſed to ſee how he beſtowed <hi>Mal Fiance,</hi> whom he brought unto the other two Pilgrims, that were wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a little a ſide from them, But when the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf unto him, <hi>Mal Fiance</hi> fell down at his feet for mercy, &amp; riſing, threw up his Hat into the ayr, and cryed aloud, the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> God ſave my Lord the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unexpected, and moſt fortunate accident, made all the company at the hearing thereof, to ſhowt for joy: And the good <hi>Vray Eſperance</hi> haſtily lighting from his Horſe, fell upon his knee, and kiſſing his hand ſayd; Long may my Liege Lord the <hi>Dolphin</hi> live. Whereat the <hi>Dolphin</hi> ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, embraced him, and told him, that as his loyalty, was crowned with renown, ſo would he adde honour, and reward to his vertues. But forget not, ſayd he, my Lord,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59993:88"/>to welcome this noble and heroicall <hi>Moor,</hi> the thrice worthy Knight of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> that both hath preſerved me from death and thraldom, and delivered you and my Country, from our oppreſling foes. O with what joy, and aſtoniſhment, did then this loyall rejoycing Lord haſten to kneel unto him: For though he held him leſſe then a God, yet he thought he could not be, but more then a man: <hi>Sirap</hi> ſtaying him, greeted him with all the demonſtrations of love, and reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>This done, they mounted both the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent <hi>Moor,</hi> who needs would ride bare-fac'd in their Pilgrim-Gowns through the city; <hi>Mal-Fiance</hi> waited on the <hi>Dolphins</hi> ſtirop, and <hi>Bonfoy</hi> manly carried his Maſters Shield before him, and after went the L. <hi>Vray Eſperance,</hi> with all the reſt of their retinue.</p>
            <p>Now their approach was no ſooner known in <hi>Vienna,</hi> but that they knew their welcomes by their rejoycing bels, ſtately bone-fires, and triumphing hearts.</p>
            <p>Hardly could they paſſe for preſſe of people, ſtill they came running to ſee them, eſpecially the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> whom they admired for his fame, honored for his great atchievements and lov'd for their protection. <hi>Sirap</hi> ſeemed much to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the French, whom the French themſelves did more then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
            <p>But in viewing the whole Troop, his obſerving eye, light, by chance on his faſt friend <hi>La-nova,</hi> at which ſight, he ſighed, yet thought himſelf happy in the ſight. Thus rode they one trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in themſelves, and honoured of all, At length they came to the Pallace gate, where diſmounting themſelves, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> now happy in being the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> could not but ſhed ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling teares, in tender remembrance of his too well beloved wife.</p>
            <p>But as the Generall of an Army, buries all the remembrance of his friend. in the pride and tryumph of his Conqueſt: ſo did the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s freedom from many perills, and the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his near loſt principallity, extinguiſh all ſorrow and memory of the dead <hi>Dolphinis.</hi> So that wiping his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59993:88"/>eyes, he turned himſelf towards <hi>Sirap,</hi> and embracing him, ſaid,</p>
            <p>Moſt worthy Knight and my deareſt friend, welcome to my Court, to my ſelf, and all that is mine: This Pallace, my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and I, are all at your diſpoſe; For ſo in my particular obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and by your meritorious and pleading deſerts, am I bound unto you: And longer may I not enjoy, what I now poſſeſſe, then you ſhall find my promiſes full laden with rich performance. And be further aſſured, that as I onely live by your love, and reigne altogether by your valour, ſo will I ever owe you fealty for my life, and ſtill doe you homage for my Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirap</hi> underſtanding thus much by <hi>Bonfoy,</hi> returned him humble thanks for his ſo gratefull and high eſteem, both of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his poore endevours, with proteſtation that hee never wiſhed, nor expected ſo great and undeſerved guerdons; but ſtill held himſelf moſt indebted unto his own deſires, to do him all further poſſible ſervice.</p>
            <p>This interchange of kindneſſes, gave contentment to them both, and was moſt pleaſing to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> who yet fed ſo on his freſh feeling happineſſe, that he gave in charge that all his Subjects ſhould honour <hi>Sirap</hi> as himſelf, and hold his will, as the will of their Lord; For ſo (he ſaid) is your Lords will, that next to the Lord of Hoaſts, holds his life and living of him.</p>
            <p>Then told he them, how, and with what hazard of his life, he had redeemed him from moſt baſe bondage, and cruell death: How he had left many Heathen honours, to honour him, then greatly diſhonoured; and how he had protected him at Sea from danger of Pyrats: and laſtly eſtabliſhed him in his Regal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in deſpight of his foes. And therefore many, and ſundry were the Tryumphs that now were ordained for him: but more then many, were the ſeverall thoughts that afflicted his doubtfull mind: <hi>Vienna</hi> he thought had cauſe to condemne him, ſince affection ever thinkes all times of ſtay too long, that hangs on deſert: <hi>Lainova</hi> he knew would rebuke him for violating the ſacred lawes of friendſhip in his conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59993:89"/>and his reverend Father might well queſtion his breach of love and duty, that ſo refuſed to ſhew himſelf a ſon. One while he was ready to embrace <hi>Lainova,</hi> another time to run to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and by and by he was ready preſt to fal on his knees to Sir <hi>Jaques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now did he pitty diſtreſſed <hi>Vienna</hi> (who in all theſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was neither moved nor removed,) Then did he fear her liberty, ſince her Father had no feeling of her calamity. Thus dubiouſly perplexed in mind, he ſadly ſate, unregarding regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the continuing and maintaining juſts, untill the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> judging of his ſtormy thoughts, by his clouded countenance, thus awaked him by his interpreter.</p>
            <p>What think'ſt, ſaid he, my beſt worthy friend of our French Knights? and how ſtands our Court ſports with your liking? <hi>Sirap,</hi> whoſe Martiall mind was now mollify'd with milder and calmer thoughts, by his man thus anſwered. As Knights of of good regard, I regard your Knights; and as noble befitting ſports, I commend your Heroicall paſtimes. All doth well, and well doth it ſtand with your Highneſſe that hath Knights that can do ſo well.</p>
            <p>But the juſts being ended, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> that had read his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment in the deep characters of his face (for the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance oft ſhewes the affects and paſſions of the heart) took him by the hand, and privately led him into a fair tapiſtred gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, hanged with moſt artificiall pictures of greateſt Monarchs, where he thus againe aſſayed to find the cauſe of his diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
            <p>Let not (ſaid he any doubt diſmay my lifes preſerver, nor let any remembrance of your laſt and loſt honours work in you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny repenting humour, ſince <hi>Viennues Dolphin</hi> is both willing and ready, both to accompliſh your demand, and to honour you with all Dginities. What pleaſeth <hi>Sirap,</hi> pleaſeth the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and nothing ſhall content the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> but what ſhall well like <hi>Sirap.</hi> Then ask my Lord, and be Lord of your asking. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rap</hi> thus kindly intreated and encouraged, lowly humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by <hi>Bonfoy</hi> thus replyed.</p>
            <p>Know moſt renowned, and thrice worthy Prince, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59993:89"/>doubtfull ſuſpition harbours not in noble hearts: nor think I once of honours change. Your covenanted promiſe exiles that doubt, and the effect of my requeſt, is the honour that beſt will pleaſe my mind.</p>
            <p>Then let me ſhew, and ſhewing crave, both what troubleth your ſervant, and what he now (in all humility) demands for his conditioned gift, not affecting honours, the worlds fading glory: nor coveting riches, mans pleaſing evill; but ſeeking contentment in loves felicity, I aske, claime, and require, your daughter my Lord, for my wife, and a wife for my reward. The renown of her attractive vertues, and the vertue of her moving perfections, hath by report ſo captivated my freeſt thoughts ſince my comming to <hi>Viennois,</hi> that wondring at her Fame, I am wounded with Fancy, and my deſire is to ſee and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud her excellencies. Then let it not ſeem ſtrange unto you, that unſeen perfections have thus wrought unknown paſſions, ſince the ear is as well ſubject to conceit, as the eye is pliant to affection.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> whoſe unnaturall and impenitrable heart felt no longer remorce of her endured miſery, then whileſt hee was himſelf in miſery; and who was no ſooner free, but that he freed his remorced thoughts, from all thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce: In ſo much, that looking neither after her impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor his own poſterity, he in his ever over awfulneſſe ſhewed himſelf now rather an unrelenting Tyrant, then a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing Father. But now thus urged by <hi>Sirap</hi> (whoſe warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted demand, and higheſt deſerts, might well challenge an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute grant) he herein (ſtill diſcontented) thus contented <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing I ſee (right noble, valiant, and moſt meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Moore</hi>) ſeemeth worſe to love. then to preferre any thing before it ſelfe; For cloathe Deſire in plates of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Gold, and Deſire will ſhiver all for colde; and fill affections purſe with treaſure, and fancy wanting content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſtarve for hunger: ſo that nothing can ſatisfie Love, but love. Your deſerts might well have challenged my Principallity for your due, my Dignities for your right,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59993:90"/>and all my treaſure for your own. But all theſe I ſee ſuffice not, becauſe they ſatisfie not; And to ask you why, is to ask one half pyned why he is hungry.</p>
            <p>You love my Lord, you love but whom? my daughter; yea that is my grief; Not that you love her, unworthy your love but that I cannot give you her more then worthy her. For ſuch I ſwear (by the eternall and my all-preſerving God) hath been and yet is, the undutifulll, and moſt obſtinate will of my too diſobedient and degenerate daughter, that never yet, nor yet ever could I, or ſhall I (I fear) perſwade, intreat, or enforce her to conſent to any, in royall rank, worth or Majeſty ſuitable to herſelf.</p>
            <p>For many times many powerfull Princes, that ſued for her favour, ſhe hath both careleſly diſreſpected, and ſcornfully refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; And as many times, many times, hath ſhe therein my will diſobeyed, and contemned. Not regarding her renown, ſhining in their glory Nor reſpecting my contentment nor progeny, eclipſed both in her, neglect of me, and in her afforded favour to her far inferiours, which cauſed me in juſtice to puniſh her hatefull diſobedience with impriſonment, and yet in nature to bewail her impriſonment, though enforced by Juſtice, Where I left her, there (ſo you pleaſe) may you find her, a priſoner to her will, that will not yet ſubmit her ſelf to my will; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by my will; worthily chaſtiſed without offence to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>For where nature, offendeth law, there law may juſtly be executed on Nature. Aſſay her (moſt worthy of all worth) and put in ballance your fortune with your fancy, and if your hap may drown her favor, you ſhall redouble the ſmal remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my aged dayes, and well ſatisfie the juſtice of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, with the honour of your deſired affinity. All my right is yours; your demand, my conſent, and my conſent a full fathers grant. <hi>Sirap</hi> acknowledging this his ſo great bounty, gave him more thankes then if he had preſently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled and inveſted him in the Principallity of <hi>Viennois:</hi> Yet ſaid he, it ſeems not over-ſtrange to me, nor ſhould it be ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to your Highneſſe, that one ſo enriched by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59993:90"/>ſo admired for vertue, and ſo endowed by fortune, ſhould herein againſt all nature, ſo reſiſt the law of nature; ſince fancy is altogether guided by Deſtiny; and Love is neither ſubject to duty nor reaſon. Then ſeeing that love yeeldeth neither reaſon of choiſe nor change; I wil leave to reaſon further of it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture once to carry up a diſh to <hi>Venus</hi> table, that never yet ſerved in her Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> glad that his demand, was of no greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſecretly ſmiled at his ſimplicity, that neglecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours higheſt advancements, onely contented himſelf with the naked hope of impoſſible ſavors.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Sirap</hi> being more aſſured then the <hi>Dolphin</hi> did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf, reſted thankfully contented with the ſame; And the next morning in the pride of his ſecret joy he went unto the Caſtle where (having the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s ſignet, for his warrant) he called for <hi>Vienna,</hi> who fearing ſome ſudden ſtratagem, (for all her hope of welfare was dead) fearefully came to the door, to know the end of her puniſhment. But when <hi>Sirap</hi> ſaw the alteration, that vertuous conſtancy had wrougnt in her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, grief ſo attach'd him, that he was more mottified at the ſight, then he was Moorefied in ſight; yet after ſome ſecret digeſted ſighes, he cheared up his ingrieved ſpirit, with the joy he had to ſee her, and thus by his interpreter he ſaluted her.</p>
            <p>Our Gods of all happineſs make fair <hi>Vienna</hi> happy in her deſires, and more fortunate in her life. The ſame <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Anoble cauſe, ſaid <hi>Sirap</hi> may yet help to heale a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous caſe; Then leave theſe forlorn walls, and let not your will make you a priſoner, that may live in my love a Princeſſe. For know (Madam) that your Father being a priſoner in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and allotted there to a moſt baſe and cruell death; I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59993:91"/>though by kind an unpaſſionate Moor, yet (much more then any Moor) pittying the miſeryes of others, had ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on your Fathers diſtreſſe, that growing careleſſe of my eſtate (being there then entertained with greateſt ſtate) I adventured with great adventure, to acquit him of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bondage, and more cruell death; Conditionally, that upon my arrivall with him in this Country; hee ſhould grant me, without all exception, one gift, that then I ſhould require; which he then ratified by oath in ſight of his God, and now hath confirmed it, by will in the preſehce of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Now Madam, hearing the well worthy renowne of your renowned beauty, though being by Nature fierce, yet ſubject to affection, I could not but in that frailty, yeeld to human condition. And therefore prizing my content be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Crown, I required your Ladyſhip for my Wife, which your Father by an Oath hath granted, which you in duty ſhould yeeld unto, and which I in love (if love can merit ſuch happineſſe) do deſerve, and yet moſt humbly do requeſt. <hi>Vienna</hi> thus moved, removed thus his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and aſpiring hope. If, ſaid ſhe, my Father enjoy a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond life by your conditionall adventure, you may Preſſe him to the performance, ſo farre, as it is in his power to accompliſh; more you cannot ask, leſſe hee will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>But know Sir Knight, that love knowes no ſuch paternall law, that never yet was ſubject to any law. The Father hath but a conſent not the choiſe, in the daughters affections; his free thoughts have no feeling of her conceit; and his mettle mind, and corrupted humors, are oft unpleaſing to his childs fancy; Neither ſtands it with any reaſon, that he cannot govern his own paſſions, ſhould command othere affections. Then muſt you of neceſſity, excuſe his impoſſibility, and admit onely of his willingneſſe; that can give nought but conſent for his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>Yet Madam, by your favour (ſaid <hi>Sirap</hi>) ſtands the daughter bound for her Fathers good, and the guerdon is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59993:91"/>but ungratefull, that is required in contempt. True, ſaid <hi>Vienna,</hi> but every good muſt not be rewarded with the beſt, leſt the beſt want fit requitall for due deſert. Let it then ſuffice, that with thanks I acknowledge your great good, and in any other things will be ready to pleaſure you.</p>
            <p>Only in this, pardon me my Lord, for in loves infirmities I have no affinity, A troubled ſoul onely in tears, her comfort ſeeks. It is a heavy comfort, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> that in mourning ſtands, yet, ſaid ſhe, doth the cuſtome of ſorrow leſſen the grief, and it is ſome comfort to be void of all comfort. Diſpair, ſaid <hi>Sirap,</hi> is mother to death, and death not fit companion for beauty. My beauty, ſaid ſhe (poor as it is) hath already bin my bane, and made me moſt unfortunate in my moſt fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Why Madam, quoth he, hath your Grace bin deceived? So ſaid ſhe, ſay they that told me ſo. But truth, he replyed, ſtands not on the tongues of men; True, ſhe ſaid, and that is the cauſe why we are deceived by men: you miſtake me much, ſaid <hi>Sirap:</hi> Nay ſaid ſhe, not miſtaken, but overtaken you in the truth, and ſo ſhe bad him farewell, leaving him tormented in mind, in that he geſt by her laſt words, that ſome one to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himſelf, or in malice to him, had wronged him in words: yet could he not but ſmile, to think how his conceit was her deceit.</p>
            <p>But leaving her, whom he meant not ſo to leave, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſay her again, he returned to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and told him of his hapleſſe ſucceſſe. Who ſmothering his inward joy, made ſuch ſhew of diſcontentment, that the angry Oceanſwel'd not as he ſeem'd to ſtorm.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sirap</hi> neither waying his anger, nor her anſwer, all ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſaid, that once more he would with <hi>Ixion,</hi> aſſay to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Juno,</hi> and ſee whether in ſhuffling again of the Cards' Fortune would deal him a better game. For he would owe her himſelf, and try whether in his own language he could wean, and win her to his will, which moved great laughter, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred further occaſion of pleaſant talk. Thus they paſſed for the reſt of the day, untill Supper, which ended, <hi>Sirap</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59993:92"/>giving them the good night, went to his Chamber, where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind <hi>Vienna</hi>'s words, which in his ſuppoſe, argued to report of his diſloyalty, which grieved him much that her grief would be redoubled by his never intended falſity, and that he ſhould bee ſo wronged by unwronged, and unknowne men.</p>
            <p>But after he had a little fed his ſad humor with this decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conceit, he determined darkly that dark night to ſhew his conceit thereon, and to remove that vail of miſdeem that ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the aſſurance of his faithfulneſſe. And therefore furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing himſelf with a well tuned lute, in the dead of night, he went alone to the Caſtle, where cloſe ſhrowding himſelf under her window, he ſweetly ſounding, thus chanted out this irefull ſong.</p>

And therefore reſolved to live to none but <hi>Paris</hi> (though <hi>Paris</hi> hath forgotten <hi>Vienna:</hi>) how ſhall I non-ſuit his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, whoſe proud hope promiſeth love, and whoſe love is warranted by my Fathers Oath. <hi>Izabella</hi> moſt carefully to acquit her of that care (though it was the leaſt care of her care) told her, that her old putrified policy, would eaſily prevent that miſchief; and therefore having a ready Capon in the Caſtle, they preſently diſmembring the body, took the two legs, and bidding them under her arm-holes, where the heat of her body might ſooneſt corrupt them, ſhe preparedly expected his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the next day.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Sirap</hi> clad in his richeſt array, ſtrangely faſhioned, came accompanied with many, that of purpoſe (being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his intention) came to recreate themſelves with his ſo ſuppoſed unuſuall courting.</p>
            <p>For he being as they thought, not to be underſtood by his tongue, nor to be ſatisfied by his ear; They vainly imagined, that he either would woe her with gifts or with his countenance, or with variety of geſtures.

Love, ſweet Love, he ſaid, hath made my tongue your Country-man, and my heart your ſervant: Then hath Love (ſhe replyed) wrought a wonder in you, and an admiration in me. Such (ſaid <hi>Sirap</hi>) is the divine power of Loves Diety, ſuch the vettuous force of your heavenly beauty, and ſuch the happy iſſue of our decreed deſtiny. Therefore, yield <hi>Vienna, Vienna</hi> yield, to that, which the Gods have decreed, Love commands, thy beauty requires, our Fortune allots, thy Father wills, and I thy friend requeſt. <hi>Vienna</hi> thus charged, could not tell how to diſcharge her ſelf
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59993:94"/>of him, but by having a recourſe to her wonted and hidden po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; And therfore uncloathing her Ivory breaſts, ſhe all ſighing ſaid, Alas Sir Knight, thy commendable demeanor, and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth, well merits favour; and thy inticing tongue is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to intrap a well-adviſed mind, and a far more ſtayeder conceit. But know, moſt noble, and moſt magnificent <hi>Moor,</hi> that I am far worſe then I ſeem, and much better then I would be. For behold (ſhe bared her breaſts that he might behold) the untimely corruption of my blaſted beauty, look on the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fruit of my long and grievous impriſonment, and but feel; O feel not the filthy ſcent of my ulcered and rotting bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and then tell me, whether I am not rather to be loathed, then loved; ſled from, then followed. <hi>Sirap</hi> aſtoniſhed at her words, but beyond all amazement, danted with the ſmell, neer fainted thereat; ſuch was his inſufferable ſorrow for her, that he curſt himſelf for her; And yet ſuch was the conſtancy of his never dying love, that encouraging himſelf, the better to cheer her up, he with a joyfull countenance, ſaid; Be it Madam ſo, or worſe then ſo, or what ſo you will; it ſhall not matter, I reſt wholly yours, if for yours, you will accept of me, that am none but yours.</p>
            <p>For know, moſt conſtant, and my endeared Lady, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> (if <hi>Paris</hi> be not forgotten) pleadeth now in perſon for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and here offereth his life, and ſervice for your love. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof, ſee here the happy ſeal of your love, and the ſole comfort of my abſence, the loyall, and unvaluable Ring, your Highneſs gave me, when firſt being peruſed by your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Knights, I departed from you, like a hungry Infant pulled from his Nurſes breaſt, or a thirſty Hart chaſed from a ſweet Fountain. Then, then in the pride of your perfections, you para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd me in the heaven of your love; and now in the decay of your glory will I wed my everliving conſtancy, to your never dying loyalty.</p>
            <p>Look, nay look not on me ſo ſtrangely; my black hue is but an artificiall vizour, and my borrowed countenance, but the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of my ſafety.</p>

               <hi>Vienna</hi> not able on the ſuddain to entertain ſo great a joy,

Ah <hi>Paris, Paris,</hi> thy love made me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented priſoner, but thy long abſence hath made my priſon a tormenting hell. But now, O happy now; thy thrice happy return makes my priſon ſeem a Paradiſe, and my hell a moſt glorious heaven; with that falling on his breſt, and encloſing him within her fainting arms, ſhe often redoubled, her double doubled kiſſes. <hi>Paris</hi> being likewiſe ſurprized with fulneſs of joy, loſt himſelf in her armes, but being acquitted of that extaſie, he payd her large intereſt for her kindneſſe, pleaded ſorrow for her martirdome, and meer neceſſity for his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Ceaſe <hi>Paris</hi> ſhe ſayd, my <hi>Paris</hi> ſurceaſe theſe needleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes of faultleſſe injurie, ſince to over fortifie innocency, is to breed ſuſpition. There is none but I, that have (if offended) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. As firſt in being cauſe of thy exile, then of thy dangerous travells, and now in rejecting thy love; but impute the firſt two to my Fathers ſeverity, not to my love, and the laſt of my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not to my inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof ſee here, (here ſhewed ſhe the Capons legs) the triall of my truth, which but in pollicy I uſed in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, to wirhſtand importunate Suters, and all only to love none but thee, earſt the ſole hope of my life; but now the only life of my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Thus pleaded ſhe to pleaſe him, and thus it pleaſed him, to praiſe her, and both of them ſtill joying, in that they enjoyed each other. Then turning to <hi>Izabella,</hi> he kiſt her many times, and vowed, that out of his beſt fortunes he would be thankfull to her, for her love to him, but eſpecially for her comfort to <hi>Vienna,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And taking them both by the hands he told them how, and by what means, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> her Father had freely, and abſolutely given her to him. And therefore he requeſted them to conceal their knowledge of him, and to go along with him, for that he meant to have her father to deliver her to him;

            <p>But when they were come before the <hi>Dolphin, Paris</hi> (for now is <hi>Sirap</hi> turned again to returned <hi>Paris</hi>) holding her by the hand, humbly requeſted, in the preſence of his daughter and Barons, to ratifie his vowed gift.

            <p>To which ſhe in all reverence, (praying pardon) ſaid. That the black ſmeared Smith was moſt pleaſing to the Queen of beauty; That that conſtant colour unfadable in it ſelf, well argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſtancy in the perſon. That his barbarous nature, was hoth reclaimed, and refined by his more civill education; and that his Religion would eaſily be conformable to their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, But howſoever, it ſufficeth, that I love him, and love yeelds no reaſon of choiſe, nor hath any reſpect of perſons. His blind deity, blinds our fancies; and fancy lives not in deſerr but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. We love altogether by liking, not for honours; and our will connot command our affections, that are not in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Then vouchſafe my Soveraign Lord and moſt gracious Father, of my deſtinied deſire. and admit of his well-merited demand, and let me with your free conſent enjoy him for my Husband that hath ſo well purchaſed me for his Wife: ſo ſhall you honour your ſelfe in doing him right: reward his ſervices, enworthy your poſterity, and repair my decayed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſeeing that it wrs but in vaine to reſiſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall influence, preordinate by Providence divine. and that he could neither in honour, nor conſcience, infringe his obliging Oath, nor reject his pleading and glorious worth; ſhewed a vertue in neceſſity, and freely gave, and delivered her unto him,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59993:96"/>
Now <hi>Paris</hi> being thus poſſeſt of his deſire, caſt off his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall mask, and lowly on his knees, ſhewed and preſented himſelf, the humble and thankfull ſervant of his Lord.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> finding himſelf thus deceived by him, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily deceived the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and his Keepers for him; could not but commend his loyall love, and love him for his ſaving ſervice. His ſuperlative valour, and unvaluable vertue, ſhewed that his great fortunes were but Miniſters to his will.</p>
            <p>And therefore he cheerfully ſaid. In <hi>France</hi> was I honoured by <hi>Paris,</hi> In <hi>Babylon</hi> unthralled by <hi>Sirap,</hi> And at home, both I, my Country, and People, were protected by the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Paris</hi> therefore I return my love, To <hi>Sirap</hi> I give my Daughter, And to the Knight of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> I yield my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality.</p>
            <p>Then my beloved and renowned Son give me thy hand, and let me embrace thee with thy valour. And here I ſwear by the all-ever-living-God, that if I were ſole Monarch of the whole Univerſe, thou onely ſhouldſt rule for me, and after me: More I cannot give thee for thy <hi>Aſian</hi> loſt honours, leſſe thou ſhalt not have then my whole <hi>Europian</hi> dignities.</p>
